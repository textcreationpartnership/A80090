            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Could not chuſe but make mention of you in the front of this Diſcourſe; and that for theſe two Reaſons, amongſt many others:</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:169783:7"/>
            <p> Firſt, Becauſe moſt of you did ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with me in my late ſorrows, and were very willing and freely active for my enlargement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe moſt of you at ſundry times, either publiquely or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately have been partakers in hearing of what is here preſented unto your reading: And becauſe moſt have want of memory, eſpecially to retain ſpiritual and heavenly truths, I have put forth this for your hands, that through the grace of Chriſt, every one may put home unto their hearts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as every one hath need.</p>
            <p>But to be as quick as my intent, I ſhall caſt what I have to ſay to you, and thoſe whom it moſt concerns, into two or three words, as followeth:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Word or two by way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</item>
               <item>2. A word by way of Caution.</item>
               <item>3. But a word, and that by way of Councel.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Account: To
<pb facs="tcp:169783:8"/> teſtifie that about ſix moneths ſince, a Thankſgiving Sermon for that great deliverance at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under my name, intituled, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and works of wonder;</hi> which Sermon I own, and doubt not but that it is both Orthodox, and Conſonant to the Doctrine of the Scripture, and the harmony of the late reformed Churches: And this I teſtifie againſt any ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Recantation or Satisfaction, knowing nothing therein for ſubſtance, but what is agreeable to the word of God: And if any can prove or make appear the contrary; namely, any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or untruth worthy recantation; or any thing of wrong, which meriteth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: Let ſuch an offence be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily pickt out, and as publiquely ſtated; and let not any doubt but a ready Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhall chearfully be acknowledged: But to give ſatisfaction where no wrong appears; and a recantation, where no error is found, were to injure truth, and ſtabliſh error: But <hi>interdictum eſſe jure naturae.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:169783:8"/>
            <p> As for any expreſsions of tartneſs, if they be but words and not untruths; why ſhould I be made an offender, or any man to be offended for a word? words have their weight, but it is matter makes an Accuſation; and my wiſh is, ſince no man nominally is accuſed by me, that none as from me would accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>And though ſome have a faculty to take every thing in the worſt, who have a minde to make things odious: I ſay, though ſuch can extract poyſon out of any expreſsion; yet conſcientious hearts will not: And as for others, let them know, I was not light, but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſimilitude: And moſt know, that compariſons are not concluſions; they are to ſet off, yet they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: <note place="margin">Verba in defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus poſita, non actum ſed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</note> And this is no ſtrange rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Logicians, <hi>That words uſed in definition, do not ſignifie the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act indeed; but the power, apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the inclination thereunto:</hi> And if in definitions; why not in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:169783:9"/>
            <p> Secondly, In way of Account: Having been about two years upon the expoſition of the 5, 6, 7, Chapters of <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, I delivered for Doctrine, from the ſcope of the 9 Ver. in the 6. Chapter, <hi>That the Lords Prayer, improperly, (though vulgarly) counted and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo, was but part of Chriſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and none of Chriſts Prayer:</hi> For Chriſt could not pray for pardon of ſin, in a proper ſenſe, who was without ſin, neither guile found in his mouth: This I thought good to aſſert in this Epiſtle, to ſilence, if not for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſuch who think I ſhould be aſhamed to publiſh, preach and own ſuch Doctrine, becauſe they will wilfully and ignorantly wrangle againſt the clear truth of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By way of Account; which is the leaſt of all, yet ſomething there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as a motive unto my ſelf to publiſh theſe notes; namely, to ſilence ſuch tongues which are too too apt for any Accuſation, charging me that I preach
<pb facs="tcp:169783:9"/> nothing but other mens labors: But to teſtifie that I do not ſteal, but ſtudy, and according to my poor mite labor in the Word and Doctrine: not what I have received from men; but what I have received from the Lord, that I have delivered unto you, comparing ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things with ſpiritual; ſtudying the Scriptures againſt mens diſtempers, that if by any means I might be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuductor, to draw any out of the fire of their ſins, into the ſaving knowledge of the love of the Lord Jeſus: This in way of Account.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By way of Caution: Take heed of a prejudiced ſpirit in any of you againſt truth; though it comes unto you in never ſo plain a ſtile; yet if truth, eſteem of it, though it come unto you in an earthen veſſel; though the perſon be deſpiſed, yet let not the endeavor: It is a great fault of ſome, who are very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and apt to repreſent the dark part of things, but will over look the light: All the good endeavored ſhall not once
<pb facs="tcp:169783:10"/> be mentioned; but if but a ſeeming fault, that ſhall be aggravated and heightned: This hath been hitherto my lot and portion; and therefore I muſt give it by way of caution.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, by way of Councel: Theſe are evil times, wherein too too many depart from the faith which was given to the Saints, that trifle and ſlight the precious truths of the Lord Jeſus: But O, do you keep cloſe with God, and to your Chriſtian principles; let none take your Crown from you, be not aſhamed of the Goſpel, nor a ſhame to the Goſpel; hold faſt your profeſsion, with a holy converſation; be burning and ſhining lights in your generation, <hi>Fighting the good fight of faith, and perſevering unto the end, that through mercy you may have an entrance into everlaſting glory.</hi> Two things let me intreat:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Read and conſider; for it is with Sermons as with a playſter: Let
<pb facs="tcp:169783:10"/> the playſter be never ſo ſoveraign, yet if not applied unto the ſoar, it profiteth nothing: So if Sermons be never ſo ſoveraign, ſpread with promiſes never ſo precious and threatnings never ſo ſearching; yet if not applied, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is perſwaded to a poor perplexed and ſick fearing ſoul: nor no malady aſſwaged or removed from the brawny and ſin-feſtered ſouls; therefore medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and conſider.</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Read and reſolve, as you have daily new Moans, and new Mercies, ſo daily new reſolutions; as a daily dawning, ſo a drawing nigh to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; yea, an earneſt, lively, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, daily motion of lifting up the head and heart for our redeemer; yea, higher and higher, for the time is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſhorter: Our Ieſus will come, and will not tarry; for whoſe expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and appearance, let us wait and watch; and watch and wait; and
<pb facs="tcp:169783:11"/> watch and pray; and pray and ſay, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly:</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:169783:12"/> every expreſſion, and as much as in them lieth, be ſaving from the worlds ſpleen, and Chriſts diſhonor: But to one another, certainly ſome grains of allowance, not exacting their labors, but ſweetly to practiſe that preſcript of that gallant Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2. whoſe expreſs is for Chriſtians <hi>to bear one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt;</hi> and if a bearing, then certainly a forbearing; and not a ploughing long furrows of ſpight and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement upon the backs of weaker bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; knowing the frame of a Goſpel ſpirit is for condeſcention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>you that are ſtrong, bear with them that are weak;</hi> not wilful; ſo Chriſt be preached, it ſhould be a Chriſtians glory, not his grief: <hi>Herein will I joy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1. 18. not wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, as the manner of ſome is, who would be counted great maſters of the Aſſemblies; who inſtead of encouraging, are leſſening and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, if not deſpiſing the day of ſmall things: Yet hoping better things of you, <hi>that you will be ſo like minded unto Chriſt, as not to break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> hath made me thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrous to put forth into the Main; I mean, the publique, this little book or bottom of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: That quietly it ſhould paſs, without ſome ſtorms and tempeſts, I do not expect,

            <p>I had not thought to have preſt into the preſs, much leſs into the publique, had not ſome God-fearing ſouls preſt me thereunto; for whoſe ſakes I was put upon the firſt ſort of theſe meditations; and at their requeſts drew it into manuſcript; for whoſe ſake it is thus publiſhed: And becauſe Miniſters are to divide to every one their portions in due ſeaſon, without fraud or flattery, I have not onely held forth comfort to dejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed ſouls; but alſo terror to the careleſs, carnal and incorrigible; knowing we are to eye in all our preaching, deſperate ſinners and deſparing Saints: The one needs Corra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives,

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Bodies of men do live in contrarieties, ſo do men [uſually] as men, if you take them in Nature or Grace. Only we muſt obſerve with this difference; That look what is moſt proper to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169783:14"/> Child of Grace, that be ſure the child of Nature will moſt counterfeit: And contrary, what is more proper to the Child of Nature, that the Child of God is moſt incident unto. As for example.</p>
               <p>The Element that a wicked man ſhould properly live in, is fears and ſorrowings. So ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking to the friends of this world, <hi>Jam</hi> 4, 9. <hi>Be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, mourn and weep; let your laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be turn'd to mourning, and your joy to heavineſs;</hi> yea, howl and weep for your miſery that is approaching, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 1. Every wicked man hath fearful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and ought to have ſorrowing ſpirits and howling hearts. But now how contrary is the race they run? Who more jocund then they? Sometimes they may have flaſhings of conſcience; but it is like the lightning, quickly gone: they have not ſuch fears and diſmayings as are incident unto Gods children. Let a wicked man want or abound, the falſe joy muſt ſtill be full: <hi>No bonds in their death, their ſtrength is firm,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>But now on the other ſide, Take but the Church or a Saint of God, whoſe proper element is to be full of joy and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169783:14"/> chear; and how contrary? What leſs then of joy? what more then of grief &amp; ſorrowings? notwithſtanding they are called for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and ſing: yea, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Th. 5. 16. <hi>Rejoyce evermore; yea rejoyce, and again I ſay rejoyce:</hi> Let your whole life be a melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and full of mirth. But now how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant are they in ſable? their eyes bedew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tears, their hearts with ſighs; fears and diſmayings begirt them round about. Well, Chriſtians, God the Father and Chriſt the Son takes notice of it. Saith Chriſt, <hi>Ioh</hi> 14 1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi> but reſt, depend, rely; <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Though the wicked riſe high in their falſe and fleeting joy, yet know (believing ſoul) Chriſt is for you, and the <note place="margin">Sera &amp; certa vindicta Dei.</note> Father is for you: And though he comes <hi>ſlow,</hi> yet he comes <hi>ſure:</hi> yea, he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf on your behalf, given you his promiſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 18. and his hearty love is in it. <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come to you.</hi> And this is not only Chriſts, but the Fathers expreſs too: <hi>Fear not, be not diſmayd; I will help thee, I will uphold thee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now what's the matter thy ſoul is ſtill caſt down? thy heart ſo full of ſighs, thy eyes ſo full of tears? Come hither in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169783:15"/> the name of Jeſus. I ſummon every inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, drooping, doubting Chriſtian, to bring in all your fears, all diſmayings, yea all objections, let them be what they will. Here's that in the Text will anſwer all, let the ſouls neceſſities be what they will. If the <hi>Father of comfort</hi> can help, if the <hi>God of conſolation</hi> can cure thee, if he that trod the wine preſs alone, that <hi>led captivity captive,</hi> and triumphed over death and hell, yea, if Chriſt <hi>the right hand of Gods right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs</hi> can ſuſtain thee, all this in this Text is held out unto thee: for ſo the 14. <hi>verſe</hi> tels thee, <hi>Fear not thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Iſrael; I will help thee, ſaith the Lord, and thy Redeemer the Holy one of Iſrael.</hi> Compare this but with the Text, and you may clearly gather, the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt is to ſet out the tender care and zeal of God the Father and Chriſt the Son, to ſtop the current of fears and diſmayings which are ſo incident unto his Church and people. This truth ſpeaks <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 3 7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I have ſurely ſeen the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Videndo vidi cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò &amp; ſeriò.</note> 
                  <hi>affliction of my people, and I have heard their cry by reaſon of their taskmaſters, for I know their ſorrows.</hi> If God take ſuch acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his people while in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the child is in darkneſs; what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169783:15"/> doth he do, the Child being <hi>light in the Lord Jeſus?</hi> In the Text, you have him like a husband, who knowing his wives weakneſs and miſtruſtings, will lay in ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of his love to take off jealouſies and fears. Though I am abroad, ſaith the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>yet ſtill I am with thee; I am at home, my Love, and my care is ſtill for thee.</hi> So ſaith the Head and Husband Jeſus Chriſt unto his Church: <hi>Thou harboureſt fears and jealouſies of my love; thou thinkeſt I am like a wayfaring man ſtaying but for a night; but know my love is conſtant, and my care is tender: believe it, and be comforted; I give you no ſuch cauſe of jealouſie and fears. The world thinks thee a poor go-by-the ground, as one forſaken: A worm, and ſo is ready to tread on thee. But for my part, I am thy Redeemer, the Holy one of Iſrael: fear thou not, but chear thy heart, and free thy heart from theſe diſmayings; for I am with thee, I am thy God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus, doubting Chriſtian, does thy Head and Husband lay in ſymptoms of his zeal and realities of his love: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> c. 2. v. 5. <hi>Though I am abſent in the fleſh, yet am I preſent with you in the ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. So ſays Chriſt unto his Church, and to every believing ſoul: Though I am
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169783:16"/> abſent, yet I am preſent; and I joy in thee; why ſhouldſt not thou joy in me? However do not fear, be not diſmayed. Mark how kindly he ſpeaks it: as if he would take near and dear acquaintance with thee, communicating himſelf in the life of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: <hi>Were I with thee but as a Lord, thou being my ſervant; or as a friend, I counting you my friend;</hi> as at the 8. verſe, where he ſayes, <hi>Thou believer art my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the ſeed of Abraham my friend:</hi> this were enough. But now when God is with thee, not only as a <hi>Lord,</hi> but as a <hi>friend;</hi> not only as a <hi>friend,</hi> but as a <hi>favourer;</hi> not only as a <hi>favourer,</hi> but as a <hi>Father,</hi> yea as a <hi>Head,</hi> as a <hi>Husband,</hi> as a <hi>Redeemer;</hi> yea combining all theſe in one, <hi>I am with thee:</hi> what a ſweet pledge of love is here! Who would be diſmayed, or rather who would not be in love with ſuch a Love, whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy; at thy right hand pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Why, this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence is about every Believer; I do not ſay glorious. And it is the ſame right hand: which if evermore pleaſures do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, why ſhould ever and anon fears and diſmayings ſo affright it?</p>
               <p>Have you not ſeen the ingenuous Mother
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169783:16"/> ſitting up with her beloved Child, ſuckling and feeding it to quiet the crying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings, and in the ſwooning fits laying the head in her boſom, the child in her lap, begirts it round with her arms, ſaying, Peace my child, thou ſhalt not fall, why doſt thou faint? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Juſt thus is God our Father, in the Text: you have him as it were ſitting up with his Church and people in their ſwooning ſtate, putting his right hand of righteouſneſs round about, offering of it wine and milk. <hi>I am with thee, why doſt thou faint? Be not afraid, my Babe of grace, thou Petty fidian! Having me by thee what wouldſt thou more? Therefore be not faithleſs, but believing; be not fearful, but be chearful.</hi> I may do as the Nurſe doth ſometimes; ſhe takes away the ſtool, that the Child may cloſe and clink more faſt to her hand. So may I, ſays God, who am a Father and Mother both to a fearing Chriſtian: I may take away all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſupports on which thou art ſo apt to lean; but if I ſtand by thee my ſelf, and ſupport thee with the right hand of my own righteouſneſs, be not afraid, be not diſmayd. And that God does all this, is very clear in the face of the words: yea, and that he might faſten this upon every believer, do
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169783:17"/> but mark how the Lord avers it over and over again; <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, If you had but my bare word, you may believe me; but if <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>yea</hi> will ſerve turn, you may perceive my heart is in it too. Yea (pooreſt believer) to take off thy feares and troubles, my bowels yearn, I am in the earneſtneſs of my affections: and that's the reaſon I double and redouble my expreſſions. Therefore <hi>fear thou not, nor be diſmayed; I am with thee, I am thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the ſcope of the words, wherein you may ſee what is intended by them.</p>

               <p>I Shall not ſpin out any long diſcourſe, but preſently endeavour to anſwer all the Doubts and Fears that are ſo incident unto Gods children, whether they be ſpiritual fears or perſonal: for though all perſonal fears be not ſpiritual, yet all ſpiritual fears are perſonal; and the Believer may have theſe, and National fears too. Againſt all which, or any of which, theſe words are to be applied, that ſo diſmayings may be removed, and the ſoul ſupported with its joy and chear.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Children of light ſhould not be foyl'd in this enterpriſe, let us like the wiſe builder firſt count the coſt. And therefore, before we ſet upon theſe home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred enemies, (as theſe <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> are) let us enquire firſt what we have to anſwer.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that I meet withall to remove fears and diſmayings, is Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169783:18"/> preſence, not as glorious, but as graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly encompaſſing and ſafeguarding Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſet forth in theſe words, <hi>I am with thee.</hi> And then ſecondly, a glorious relation, in theſe words, <hi>I am thy God;</hi>

                  </note> wherein is Gods omnipreſence, his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie: And this is ſet forth to us with this enforcement, <hi>Yea, I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee,</hi> &amp;c. And then thirdly, If you would know the manner how God will ſtrengthen, help, uphold, it is with no leſs then the <hi>right hand of his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And here (methinks) every Believer may certainly ſay, as the Lord once ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies, though they were mighty and a multitude, and on his ſide they were few and feeble; yet (ſays he) they are too many. So may the child of God ſay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphingly againſt fears and doubtings: It is enough, O God, that thou ſhouldſt afford me thy ſpecial preſence; there is in that more joy and comfort, yea nothing can be grievous whilſt thou art with me; Oh what a Sun and a Shield is God! what a ſtrong Tower and Rock of defence, an Upholder and Helper! What? with the <hi>right hand of thy righteouſneſs!</hi> and, <hi>my God!</hi> What a plenty is here! I may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to fix, but not be afraid of fear; for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169783:18"/> the ſhadow of thy ſpecial preſence is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſpell all tumults, temptations, and troubles whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Awake, awake therefore, thou doubting ſoul, and view that glory that doth ſurround <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 14.</note> thee: for he that ſaid enough, when he ſaid, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> ſays enough to thy ſoul, in ſaying, <hi>I am with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Chriſt ſayes of God the Father in reſpect of moving away fears, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 8, 9. <hi>He is neer that justifieth me; who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with me? Let us ſtand together; who is mine adverſary? let him come neer to me. Behold, the Lord God will help me; who ſhall condemn me? Lo, they all ſhall wax old as a garment, the moth ſhall eat them up.</hi> So may every Believer, and every juſtified perſon by the ſame Jeſus ſay, Chriſt is neer me by his ſpecial preſence for to comfort me; what ſhall diſmay me? Stand out Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tribulation, peril, ſword! why, in all theſe things we are more then conquerors: <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 37:</note> for behold, the Lord God will help me, yea is about me by his ſpecial preſence; And darkneſs muſt have no place, when the Sun appears.</p>
               <p>And leſt we ſhould think that Chriſt ſhould ſpeak thus only of himſelf, he applies it unto us, and bids us make this uſe of it,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169783:19"/> as in the 10. <hi>v. Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that walketh in darkneſr, and hath no light? let him truſt in the name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſtay upon his God.</hi> Mark, though he ſee no light for the preſent, yea though he walk in darkneſs, yet God is with him, and he muſt not ſhrink, but take ſhelter; the name of God muſt be both his truſt and his ſtay.</p>
               <p>What a Mount of Sufficiencie was God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he tels him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>I am God all ſufficient?</hi> Here was enough to anſwer all things. Why, this ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is as much to every Son of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Nay, let me add thus much, as againſt fears and diſmayings, the <hi>ſpecial preſence of God</hi> ſpeaks more comfort then <hi>allſufficiencie</hi> doth: For though Gods <hi>allſufficiencie</hi> be of an infinite weight and conſideration, yet that may as well be allſufficient to kill as to quicken; Gods allſufficiencie may as well ſpeak death as life: but this ſpecial preſence which here God pitcheth about his Church and people, is not to ſpeak the leaſt of terror, but ſupport, comfort, and encouragement againſt all terror, affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or diſmaying.</p>

                  </label> why not <hi>Davids</hi> practice? If thy portion be the ſame, why not thy joy the ſame?

Yea, though thou thinkeſt thy ſelf a worm, God ſingles thee out in ſpecial with this, <hi>Fear not, I am with thee.</hi> And though <hi>David</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, thou art a Member; and that is more. A ſhadow hath the lineaments by reflection from the ſubſtance; but the leaſt and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Believer is a member, and ſo bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh. And if the ſame ſympathizing in fears and tears, why not the ſame heroick ſpirit over fears and diſmayings? It was a precious expreſſion, and a precious experience, that <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to a doubting ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 9, <hi>Surely his ſalvation is neer unto them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.</hi> This <hi>ſurely</hi> is thy <hi>certainty:</hi> For what is true of the

Why, <hi>David</hi> tels thee, that <hi>glory may dwell in thee.</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſaid, There is a beauty and ſplendor about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Believer, that one would not expect ſuch an Inhabitant at leaſt to dwell there, as fears and doubtings; but love, and joy, and peace, <hi>that glory may dwell,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And this is but the language of the Text; <note place="margin">

               <p>But now, may the believing ſoul ſay, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169783:22"/> an inſide glory. And ſo I may ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not;</hi> Or, <hi>Ye receive not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>ye ask amiſs.</hi> So, fearing ſoul, thou perceiveſt not, becauſe thou look'ſt amiſs. Turn but the eye of faith inward, and there is <hi>Chriſt in us the hope of glory.</hi> What ſaith <hi>David? Pſ.</hi> 45. 13. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within.</hi> The believing ſoul is clad with all the Needle-work graces: but we muſt look within, if we would ſee this beauty and ſplendor. And therefore it follows, <hi>They ſhall enter into the Kings palace.</hi> Kings daughters are not to be expected in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but in the Chamber of preſence. Enter therefore into thy Graces; there ſhalt thou ſee this glorious excellencie with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and rejoycing.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, thou ſeeſt not the glory that is round about thee by Gods ſpecial preſence, becauſe though thou lookeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, yet thou lookeſt through an infirm (I will not ſay a falſe) <hi>medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſees thee face to face, beyond fears <note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and diſmayings, but thou doſt not ſee him. Faith is like the Proſpective glaſs; it makes things that are afar off ſeem to be neer, but yet with a great deal of weakneſs: So
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169783:22"/> Faith, it diſcovers viſions of God, yea and it brings it neer; but becauſe it is an infirm <hi>medium,</hi> we ſee fears and doubtings, when indeed the object of faith is full of joys and chearings. So that we may ſay of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes of the mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it:</hi> ſo may it truly be ſaid of the eye of faith; Open it wide, yea wider, and Gods ſpecial preſence will ſhine unto the full aſſurance of light, and life, and glory.</p>
               <p>Heaven and happineſs it ſelf is but this ſpecial preſence. So ſaith <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 16. 11. ſpeaking of Gods glorious preſence, <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, at his right hand pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Why now the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Gods glorious preſence and his gracious preſence, lies mainly in this; God ſeeing us with the eye of glory, through a gracious Chriſt; we ſeeing him with the eye of grace through a glorious Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſpecial preſence of God is no leſs then heavenly joy and glory; only to us it is contracted to the narrow eye of faith; and becauſe of this, we do not ſee clearly the things that are given us of God. Like <note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> a great Volume that is put into a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Print, which one can hardly read with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169783:23"/> the choiceſt and cleareſt Spectacle. So Heaven, it is a great volume, but to every believing ſoul it is contracted into a very ſmall print; ſo that though the Creature put on the choiſeſt Spectacle of Reaſon, he cannot read a word: and the Chriſtian, though he hath on the Spectacle of Reaſon, and that which is ſuited to the Print, which is Grace, yet he can read but darkly; yet read he can, but 'tis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſcurely with <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands, fears</hi> and <hi>doubtings.</hi> And what's the reaſon? Becauſe he looks through an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>medium.</hi> But now put but off, or rather put but on the Spectacle of Glory, and then we ſhall ſee face to face, know as we are known. Yea, and the ſum of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>For now we ſee through a glaſs darkly; but then,</hi> when the eye of faith is opened to fruition, <hi>we ſhall ſee face to face,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

All earthly comforts are but Wine; and Wine may chear the heart, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104. 15. But now the love of Chriſt is ten thouſand times

So that if the queſtion ſhould be, To what end the Lord encompaſſeth the ſoul with his ſpecial preſence? it is that <hi>our joy might be full:</hi> for in his ſpecial preſence <hi>there is fulneſs of joy,</hi> Pſ. 16. 11. And if we take this fulneſs only to be in glory, why ſhould a night of ſorrow ſo much trouble us, for that joy comes in the morning? And yet being a Believer, thou art not benighted: Although the Sun be not in the Meridian, or in his higheſt altitude, yet he is riſen, and ſhines above the Horizon of <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubtings.</hi> So that to you muſt be applied that of the Prophet <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>To you that fear my name,</hi> that is, to the pooreſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul, <hi>ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings.</hi> And what joy muſt this adminiſter, when theſe wings that overſhadow thee, are no leſs then all the ſaving benefits of Chriſt?

               <p>Ah, may the ſoul ſay, that's true indeed. Yea, and ſo is the reſt too; for ſaith the Text, not only <hi>from death,</hi> but <hi>mine eyes from tears,</hi> and <hi>my ſliding feet from falling.</hi> What's this but to dry up tears and

               <p>And ſayes the Father, I am with thee by my ſpecial preſence, that thou mighteſt be ſuccoured, ſheltered, and ſupported. And therefore mark the Text; <hi>I will ſtrengthen, I will help, I will uphold thee.</hi> As if the Lord ſhould ſay, Here's thy comfort, <hi>I am with thee:</hi> thou art afraid, becauſe thou art feeble; but be thou comforted, <hi>I am thy ſtrength.</hi> Thou art afraid becauſe thou art weak; but be thou comforted, I am powerful, <hi>I will help thee.</hi> And why doſt thou fear that thou ſhalt fall?

               <p>THirdly, Know fearing ſoul, that God is not only with thee to comfort thee, but alſo to engage for thee againſt all thy Fears: and what will not the power of a Prince do, if he proclaim and proſecute? Tumults may ariſe; but if the mighty man once wager, he breaks through all, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the caſe be urgent, and himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Ah, but what if God be the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker! He that is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> He at whoſe preſence the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains melt: ſhall not he be more then Conqueror againſt ſuch poor Principalities and Powers as <hi>ſervile Fears</hi> and <hi>Troubles</hi> are?</p>
               <p>God engageth all by his <hi>ſpecial preſence</hi> for the believing ſoul, and ſpeaks it like a <hi>Victor</hi> that were ſure of the day, ſaying,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169783:28"/> 
                  <hi>Fear not, I am with thee, doubting ſoul; why art thou caſt down? my reſolution is to hold thee up, yea and I will encounter againſt all that break thy quiet.</hi> And that this is the mind of God to engage for thee, mark but his reſolution; <hi>Yea I will, yea I will, yea I will ſtrengthen, help, uphold.</hi> He ſpeaks it as a vehement undertaker of thy cauſe and quarrel, as if he would in no wiſe ſuffer his Child to be ſo battered and abuſed by any fears, and troubles, and temptations.</p>
               <p>Says the Creature, I have ſpent both time, and ſtrength, and mony; and do you think I will ſuffer this? No, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpend ſo much and ſo much more; I will engage all, but Ile accompliſh. As the faithful Subject ſaith in his Countries cauſe; <hi>Our fathers bought ſuch and ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with ſuch and ſuch expence, and ſhall we now be ſo incroacht on? nay, my life and fortune ſhall lie at ſtake firſt; I will venture all, and engage all, but I will accompliſh ſuch dear-bought priviledges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even thus ſaith God the Father to a doubting Chriſtian: <hi>I have not only bought thee with the precious blood of my dear Son, but through him I have alſo priviledged thee with the graces of my holy Spirit, whereby thou mayſt be comforted againſt fears and</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169783:29"/> 
                  <hi>troubles. But I ſee theſe gueſts are inmates in my houſes ſtill; yea theſe ſlaves which ſhould be underfoot are oft uſurpers, lording it over my ſons and daughters. But children, be of good chear I your Father will not ſuffer this, I will ſtand by you, and engage for you. Hath my Son redeemed you from your ſins? and ſhall you now be overwhelmed by ſervile fears? No, believe it, drooping ſpirit; Call forth all my ſtrength, all my power, all my love, its all at ſtake for you and all engaged for you; You know I ſent my Son for you; and in his low eſtate he ſlew the King of fears, Death and Hell, and led Captivity captive. And now I am exalted, I in him, and he in me, and you in both; and ſhall I now ſuffer you to ſuffer? No, I will not ſuffer you to be tempted, to be feared; but I will ſuccour you, I will relieve you, and ſupport you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the offending Child hath got but a friend to ſtand between it and its offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father, how will it wipe the eyes, and cheriſh hope, and creep behind, becauſe it knows it hath gotten one to ſtand between it and home! Ah, but how much more may the Child of God, who hath ſuch a friend as Chriſt to intercede, and ſuch a Father as is ſo far from being offended with his Child in caſe of fears, that he comes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169783:29"/> forth himſelf, and engageth all his love, all his grace, the leaſt drop whereof is enough to remove mountains of ſins; and why not fears and diſmayings? ſpecially conſidering that he by his ſpecial preſence ſingles out thee alone, as if ſo be he had no more but thee: for ſo the Text implies and expreſſes; I am with <hi>thee,</hi> poor fearing Chriſtian, and and all my mercy, power and grace is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for <hi>thee:</hi> and what will not the Bow of my power do, being bent with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and that againſt all your ſervile fears? I come, I ſhoot, I engage all my power, mercy, love; <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is no more then what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal found at the hands of his Father, <hi>Luk</hi> 16. who leaves all for him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages all for him, although a Prodigal and a Spend thrift; yet becauſe a Son, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's out to meet him, and no coſt muſt be ſpared, the fatted Calf muſt be kill'd. And if our Heavenly Father have ſuch a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a prodigal Son, what will he not have for thee, who art a Son, but yet a <hi>fearing one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Children of God may ſay indeed, that the <hi>ſons of Zerviah</hi> have been too hard for them: Temptation, Sin, and Satan had

               </p>

                  <hi>high; and how can I chuſe but fear when my life is in jeopardy every houre?</hi> Ah but conſider, ſo oft as thou haſt feared periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who hath delivered thee? 'Twas not thy faintings and thy fearings; for it is not by the beſt of our might or power: why then it muſt be by the Spirit of God in his <hi>ſpecial preſence,</hi> which hath been with thee in the time of all thy ſtraits and troubles; only it may be thou haſt not thought that God was thy aſſiſtant, that he was ſo neer at hand by his ſpecial preſence to comfort thee and ſuſtain thee. And if thou hadſt known and thought of this, thou wouldſt have truſted more, and doubted leſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for the future ſtill keep this in mind. That God is with thee, yea engaged for thee, and that againſt all thy fears and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayings.</p>
               <p>And if one Attribute of God may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter a world of comfort, and if one Attribute of God is an infinite ſupport; what then are all the Attributes of God, which are about every Believer, to comfort and engage againſt all their fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? Surely we may all ſay, <hi>We will not fear though the earth were removed, for the Lord is a preſent help.</hi> Yea, though I be but as a worm, a poor go-by the ground; for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169783:31"/> ſo the Text expreſſes, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Fear thou not, worm Jacob; yea, the Lord of Hoſts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge,</hi> Pſal. 46. 1. 11.</p>
               <p>God being with us, what need we fear any that are againſt us? And why? Becauſe all is engaged for us; All his Grace, all his Love, all his Mercy, all his Wiſdom, all his Strength; indeed all in God, and God in all.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in a word or two hint unto you four things, which are engaged by this <hi>[I am with thee,]</hi> which Believers are to take notice of againſt their fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>Our Father by theſe words, <hi>[Fear thou not, for I am with thee]</hi> engageth firſt his <hi>Word,</hi> ſecondly his <hi>Power,</hi> thirdly his <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> and fourthly his <hi>Honour.</hi> God hath laid all theſe, and much more at ſtake (as I may ſo expreſs it) for every Believer, to the removing away <hi>fears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In his ſpecial preſence his Word is engaged: and this the Text holds forth, being the Word of God, though penned by this Goſpel-Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> There is a twofold Word of God, the internal and external; but both are engaged againſt a Believers fears and diſmayings. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169783:31"/> word is that voyce within us, ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walk in it.</hi> And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Eternal word of the Father, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, for ſo he is called by that divine Evangeliſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. And by this Word we have the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, freeing us from the Law of ſin and death: and this the Word of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, and Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit makes good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. And then, if <hi>freedom from ſin and death,</hi> who ſhould once make doubt againſt <hi>fears and ſorrowings?</hi> And in the Scriptures, how many gracious promiſes hath the Father given thee on purpoſe for thy conſolation? All the comforting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, all the upholding promiſes, all the preſent promiſes, all the prccious promiſes are for the ſupport and comfort of every Child of God. So that though no holy things muſt be caſt to Dogs, yet all the words of Conſolation, Comfort, Joy and Peace, they are all to be dealt forth unto a believing ſoul. And therefore as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours words do invite you, ſo let them abide in you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled; Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> For both agree in words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation againſt all your fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:169783:32"/> 2. God by this <hi>ſpecial preſence</hi> engageth not only his Word, but his Power alſo: and what will not a man of power do, that will engage for a friend? But what will not the powerful God accompliſh for <hi>Jacob</hi> his friend? In caſe of temptation he ſaith to <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. And all power is in Grace, though all Grace be not in power. But both theſe are in this ſpecial preſence of God, engaging for a fearing Chriſtian. And I need go no further then the Text, to make it appear that the Lord engageth his power to take off Believers fears. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when God will ſet forth his power and greatneſs to the full, he ſaith no more but thus; <hi>I am that I am,</hi> Exod. 3. 14. <hi>And thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the children of Iſrael, [I am] hath ſent me unto you.</hi> And thus he engageth himſelf in the Text for the believing ſoul, Fear not, <hi>I am;</hi> Be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, <hi>I am.</hi> And as thoſe expreſſions, <hi>[with thee]</hi> and <hi>[thy God]</hi> do ſet forth Gods gracious relations, ſo <hi>[I am]</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power; but both oppoſing <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>diſmayings.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. God by this his ſpecial preſence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth his Faithfulneſs; he will aſſuredly perform the overcoming all thy fears. Had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169783:32"/> the Lord given us but his word of promiſe, it were enough to maſter fears, conſidering all the words of grace were written for the Saints comfort; and the Scripture ſaith. <hi>Not one jot or tittle ſhall fail till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi> And the reaſon is, <hi>becauſe he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that hath promiſed.</hi> And let us take heed by our giving way to fears we make not Gods word of none effect: for, <hi>He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that hath promiſed,</hi> yea, and he is round about us to effect it, ſaying, <hi>I am with thee, fear not, I am thy God,</hi> that is, a God in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and I will nor ſuffer thee to be tempted, feared, affrighted; but as I am with thee, ſo I will ſtrengthen, yea I will help, yea I will uphold.

               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, God engageth not only his word, his power, and his faithfulneſs againſt a Believers fears, but his Honour is at ſtake for them; and know (Believer) he will not ſuffer himſelf to be foil'd in this;

I am like a broken reed recling to and fro by every wind of temptation. Well, grant it; what if thou art?

Therefore fear thou not; for I

               <p>I ſhall not ſpeak any thing of the riſe of <hi>fears,</hi> knowing that every experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knoweth that ſin was, and is the cauſe of all ſervile fears.

               <p>THere are many ſorts of fears, yet they all may be comprehended to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or Temporal; and theſe again may be Perſonal, Family and National fears.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The worſt of fears are ſpiritual, and theſe do moſt uſually diſquiet the peace of Gods peculiar; and therefore I ſhall firſt ſpeak to them, and I ſhall be brief in each: <hi>Gird up therefore the loyns of your mindes,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 3. and bring in all your Objections; here's enough in the Text to Anſwer all, let your fears be never ſo numerous, and never ſo great.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169783:37"/> comfort and conſolation. And as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. ſo ſaith the Father by this Text, <hi>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you:</hi> Not as the world giveth, which are ready to grumble and to take it away again; but ſaith <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>that it may abide with you for ever.</hi> And why ſhould your hearts be troubled or afraid?

               <p>There are three ſpecial times of fears; but this ſpecial preſence of God to every believing ſoul will anſwer all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The hour of Temptation is a time of fear, when the ſoul is as a bird inſnared by the fowler: but then God by his ſpecial preſence makes way for the ſoul to eſcape; ſo that though the Tempter tempt never ſo craftily, yet God hath ſo promiſed to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and relieve the ſoul, that the ſoul gets coſt, and by being thus try'd, hath this crown ſet upon the head of it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he is tryed, he ſhall receive the crown of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A wicked man way-lays Satan, as well as Satan way-lays him; and being <hi>dead in tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> he is not capable what
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169783:37"/> Temptation means; and therefore is it <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 20.</note> ſaid, the Devil takes them captive at his will. But now Gods child, he finds it to go very hard ſometimes with him through tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he wreſtles, tugs and toyls; which is a clear ſign by his complainings, that his ſoul is capable. But fear not, holy ſoul; this <note place="margin">Job 5. 19.</note> is the hour God will be ſeen in the Mount, and make way for thee to eſcape <hi>out of ſix and ſeven troubles.</hi> Yea, when thou art thus try'd, thou ſhalt be crowned hereafter with glory and life; and for the preſent by Gods ſpecial preſence thou art pronounced <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> for, <hi>Bleſſed is the ſoul that endures,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 12.</note> 2. As the <hi>hour of temptation,</hi> ſo the <hi>hour of death,</hi> this is called the <hi>King of fears,</hi> and may truly be ſo to an unbeliever. But fear not thou their fear; for God is with us in this hour. And though thou thinkeſt death to be an enemy to thee, and a hard paſſage for thee to diſpute; yet if thou believeſt nothing too hard for God, then fear thou not this hour of fear; for by this ſpecial preſence God being with thee, thou haſt no leſs then the right hand of the Lords right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs; and this delivers thee from death, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 2. which is but a parallel to the Text, to let us know we ſhould not fear this <hi>hour of fear;</hi> for God being with us,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169783:38"/> we have the right hand of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And though treaſures of gold and ſilver will not, (for that will profit nothing in that day) and therefore wicked men may fear; but fear not thou; God is with thee and righteouſneſs delivers from death. 3. Being thus delivered from death, there is no fear to thee to come to Judgment, which is and will be a time of fearful fear <note place="margin">Pro. 13. 21.</note> to all wicked men: Ah, but to a child of God this is no time of fear, but of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting refreſhment. Wicked men in their life time have the powerful preſence of God, their conſcience bearing of them witneſs that they thus were always in his preſence, and they could not flie it, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 139. 7.</note> ſpeaks: but this is their miſery, they gave no regard to it. And therefore Death and Judgment are times of fear, becauſe they have Gods fearful preſence: Chriſt appears to them as a fearful Judge, and as an Avenger of all thoſe injuries offered to him, his Cauſe and Saints. And this is the cauſe why they call to the rocks and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall upon them; it is to hide them from the preſence of the Lord: Whereas <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 16.</note> the child of God hath the Judge his friend, and Chriſt his Advocate; and nothing is brought in againſt him, but he himſelf is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169783:38"/> brought in with ſhouts, and with welcome love and kindneſs: And therefore believing ſoul, ſince Gods ſpecial preſence will own you at that great day of fears and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34.</note> ſaying, <hi>Come ye bleſſed, come my children, come my ſervants:</hi> See that you own this ſpecial preſence now, when God is with you, and bids you <hi>Fear not;</hi> yea, and is ſo earneſt you ſhould believe him: Be couragious doubting ſoul, by anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods kindeneſſe, ſaying, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, It may be objected, Am not I <label type="milestone">

               <p>And therefore doubting Chriſtian take heed. Me thinks I hear thy ſighs, and ſee thy tears: Let not thy tears be tears of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, or fearful ſorrowing; for God is with thee by his ſpecial preſence, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch tears or ſorrows: And if tears will needs flow, let them be tears of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; let them be like <hi>Mary</hi>'s, not onely <note place="margin">Luke 7. 37, 38.</note> tears of contrition, but tears of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if thou wilt bedew Chriſts feet with tears, wipe them with the hairs of thy head, and kiſſe them, to let all flow from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained love, in the conſideration of this ſpecial preſence, that God is with thee: Know therefore, as thou art a Believer, all thy fears ſhould be filial; more for love,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169783:39"/> then want; and all thy tears ſhould be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, more from comfort then grief. No men laugh louder then wicked men, but this is madneſſe; and none weep and ſigh oftner then believers; but this is gladneſſe, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 126. 5. <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy:</hi> Now the ſeed is of the ſame kinde with the harveſt; and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever bearing precious ſeed, why not his life full of precious comforts? And thus much for ſpiritual fears.</p>

                  <p>Containing ſomething in general againſt Temporal fears.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next ſort of fears that are incident unto Gods children, is temporal; and they are either Perſonal Family, or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal fears. I ſhall ſay ſomething to each of theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general: They that are members of the body of Chriſt and his Church, may eaſily draw forth this concluſion, that if God the Father hath given me his Son and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169783:40"/> by this his ſpecial preſence to ſuccor me againſt fears, and my ſpiritual adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſurely he that hath done the greater, he will alſo do the leſſe: <hi>Davids</hi> ſaying is thine, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. <hi>He that delivered me out of the paw of the Lyon, and out of the paw of the Bear, will alſo deliver me out of the hands of this uncircumciſed Philiſtine:</hi> So he that hath given me ſuch comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſpiritual fear, how ſhall I lack any thing temporal that I ſtand in need on: And this is <hi>Pauls</hi> concluſion, who was and did go through a world of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own ſon, but gave him up for us all, how ſhall he not</hi> [as if he wonders that any ſhould make once doubt of it] <hi>but with him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give us all things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God our fathar is ingaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Text upon this very account. Thus obſerve the 11, 12, 13. Verſes, where he ſaith, <hi>That not onely them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt thee ſhall be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, but them that make war againſt thee ſhall periſh;</hi> let them be men or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, hunger, cold or nakedneſſe; let what will be that would break a Believers peace, they ſhall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought: And if you would know how
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169783:40"/> God will accompliſh this, he tells thee in the ſame language in the Text, as at the 13. Verſe, <hi>Fear not, I the Lord thy God will help thee, will uphold thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord ſaith indeed in the 14. Ver. that the Church and people of God are very apt to have fears and diſmayings upon a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral account, as well as on a ſpiritual; and therefore he calls the Church and every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever <hi>A worm,</hi> ſuch a one that is a poor go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>by the ground, that the world is very ready to tread and trample under foot; but fear not, I am with thee, to deliver thee as well from temporal fears, as well as from ſpiritual fears: And thus much Chriſt exhorts his Diſciples to in that of <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. compared with the 2. Verſe, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> And this he ſpeaks to ſuccor us in our natural wants, as well as againſt our ſpiritual fears; for whereas the ſoul may ſay, Jeſus Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my ſouls portion, and perpetual, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 26. but for this poor body, I know not where I ſhall abide with it; why now mark what Chriſt ſaith to ſuch a poor body, <hi>Fear not, for I am with you;</hi> and, <hi>I am with you to the end of the world:</hi> I know you are afraid of hunger, and of houſe-room;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169783:41"/> but let not your hearts be troubled, I am <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 2.</note> your harbinger, and I go to take up eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manſions for you; and it is my fathers will that you ſhould not be troubled; for he hath meat and drink enough, and houſes for you all, and none ſhall take them away from you; for my father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have no other Tenants but you; and I am reſolved to prepare them for you, and you alone; therefore let not your hearts be troubled againſt temporal fears.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, a more general text you cannot have, as being to believers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move away fears, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75. <hi>That he would grant unto us, that being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we might ſerve him without fear;</hi> that is, ſlaviſh fear; and that this is Gods grant unto Believers, the text is expreſſe, <hi>Fear not;</hi> and that it is to be againſt temporal fears, as well as ſpiritual: Compare the ſcope of this place, with that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. to which this propheſie of <hi>Zacharias</hi> hath relation: And God hath performed the mercies promiſed unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> yea, and alſo doth perform unto every ſon of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for we may all ſay, <hi>Qui loquutus eſt, &amp; juravit,</hi> which ſpake unto me, and ſware: Why now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169783:41"/> ſoul, do but add the Saints experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Lords covenant, his promiſe, and this his ſpecial preſence: And if againſt all our enemies, and that he would have us without fear, then ſurely againſt Temporal fears and diſmayings.</p>

               <p>Wicked men are often ſaying, <hi>Lord, Chriſt, Mercy, Faith!</hi> but they ſpeak at large, without any ſenſe of what they ſay.

                  <hi>came forth meat, and out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſs:</hi> So out of the Father of mercies thou mayeſt extract all kind of ſweets that thy ſoul or body ſtands in need of. <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſpeaks it by way of riddle; but anſwer thy ſoul and body too by way of reality, That if a father of children will be pittiful, and extend all for their ſupply, what will not my heavenly Father, who is a Father of mercies?

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169783:42"/> thou wilt find ſupply. Chriſtian, believe it, do but draw forth faith, and feed plentifully on mercy, for thou haſt in this an eternal maintenance, and in ſuch a maintenance there is no room left for temporal fears. I would have poor Believers do as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> doth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 5. when he went to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his Son: he goes up to the Mount with this, <hi>God will provide, my ſon.</hi> So do thou; get up into this Mount that is come down to thee, even Gods <hi>ſpecial preſence:</hi> there is a Sacrifice kill'd already; it is but for thee to eat, and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied. Thou haſt not bread, thou haſt no proviſion: Ah but haſt thou dependance? Exerciſe faith, but baniſh fears. When <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 5.</note> goes into the Mount, he leaves his ſervants below; <hi>Stay you here,</hi> ſaith he; that is, Senſe and Reaſon, Doubtings and Diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, theſe muſt be left below.

                  <note place="margin">God feeds his people two ways</note> anſwers both. <hi>I am with thee,</hi> is as well to ſuſtain thy body, as to ſave thy ſoul. Gods ſpecial preſence is a ſupply two ways to a Believer.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:169783:43"/> 1. God doth feed his Children literally, giving his Child the thing that it ſenſitively deſireth, ſo far as he ſees it convenient. Thus the ſpecial preſence works in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Promiſe; and thus thy faith is called forth by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 30. ſpeaking to his Diſciples. <hi>If God ſo clothe the graſs of the field, will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith!</hi> and why take ye thought for raiment? The Lilies of the field are but under common providence; and you are not only under that, but Gods ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is round about you; and why will you fear, O ye of little faith! And for your comfort, take that cardinal promiſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 8, 10. <hi>O taſte and ſee, the Lord is good; bleſſed is the man that truſteth in him.</hi> And ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>There is no want to them that fear him,</hi> that is, to ſuch that have faith in him. And <hi>David</hi> ſeems to ſpeak this out of experience; for he had found the Lord making his promiſe good, by feeding on him in his ſtraits and troubles. And he makes this promiſe applicable to the bodies wants, as you may clearly ſee in the 10. <hi>v. The young Lions ſhall lack and ſuffer hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any thing.</hi> The authority of this Scripture gives thee every good, if thou be an earneſt ſeeker of the Lord.</p>

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:169783:44"/> 2. Know, as God makes his promiſe good literally, ſo he doth it myſtically, and this by his ſpecial preſence.</p>
               <p>May the body of a Believer ſay, I was hungry, but I am ſupplied; my ſtomack's gone, and my thirſt is quenched, and my body is warmed. I have been grieved, tempted, troubled; but I know not how, I am now at eaſe, I have joy and chear: Surely, may the ſoul ſay, I have meat and drink and refreſhment, and none hath given it me but God by his being with me, and myſtically hath made his promiſe good in <hi>filling the hungry with good things, and</hi>

               <p>A Believers body may ſay unto a rich mans plenty, as <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſaid to <hi>Heſter: For if thou holdeſt thy peace at this time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi>

               <p>Thus may the Chriſtians experience ſay, I have been troubled in ſpirit, but I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; I have lain under temptation, but I am ſuccoured; I have many a time gone

May the believer ſay, I have but theſe two things to keep me alive, Godlineſſe and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. but I finde this is enough to anſwer all my fears, it is more then money, meat or clothes.

He doth as it were wind up another key, delighting in that wherein his heart had found joy and experimental comfort: for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169783:50"/> every Believer is in union with Chriſt, and Chriſt is in union with every Believer. Yea, here's my triumph, here's my glory; Every Believer hath not only union, but communion alſo: for between a Believer and Chriſt there is union; they are one, and not only ſo, but there is enjoyment of communion in this union, <hi>They are one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words two things are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into. Firſt, what is meant by being <hi>one.</hi> And ſecondly, what is meant by being <hi>one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> we are not to underſtand Corporal or Perſonal union; as if the Husband ſhould be the Wife, the Father the Son, or the Head the Members, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: but by being one with Chriſt, is a Spiritual and Conjugal union, an union of Relations, as Head and Members, Husband and Wife; which though they be two in appearance, yet are but one in compliance and acquaintance. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wedlock. <hi>Two ſhall be one fleſh;</hi> that is, man and wife ſhall live, and move, and act together for each other. So Chriſt and every Believer, though they be different perſons, as head and members, husband and wife, yet they both have but one Father,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169783:51"/> one houſe, one home; they live and move and act together, have one compliance, one acquaintance, one enjoyment, one in love, one in heart, one all. And the ſumm of this is eminently ſet forth in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. from the 23. <hi>v.</hi> to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is meant by being <hi>one Spirit:</hi> for this is Spiritual conjunction. In cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral conjunctions there is a union in fleſh; but this union of Chriſt with the ſoul is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, <hi>they are one Spirit.</hi> By <hi>Spirit</hi> here we are not to underſtand the eſſential being of God or Chriſt; for he is ſaid to be a Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> He ſpeaks it of his univerſal nature, as he is Infinite and Omniſcient: thus neither Angels or men are in union with him, onely Jeſus Chriſt, who is God equal with the Father, bleſſed for ever, comprehending all things, by whom all things ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Spirit</hi> here is meant the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the gifts and graces of God, whereby he doth cooperate and work in our hearts a conformity to all thoſe holy ends and purpoſes as he hath awarded in his Word to all the faithful in Chriſt Jeſus. So that by <hi>Spirit</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>fruits of the Spirit.</hi> And thus you may have a Cloud of witneſſes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>But if the</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:169783:51"/> 
                  <hi>Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, He that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> That is, If God dwell in your hearts by faith, all the current of your lives will be to dwell in him by love, by hope, and by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Thus <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>God hath ſent forth his Spirit into our hearts, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Here is the Spirit of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and of Grace ſent from the Spirit of Power and Glory, <hi>God hath ſent.</hi> So <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28, <hi>I will pour forth my Spirit on all fleſh.</hi> Here is the Spirits pouring forth the Spirit, namely the fruits of the Spirit, which are <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith,</hi> &amp;c. which Spirit coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in our hearts, through which we have communion in our union.</p>
               <p>I ſhall caſt all that I have to ſpeak at this time from theſe words, into theſe three Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How may a Believer and Chriſt be ſaid to be one Spirit?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Evidences may I have, that my ſoul and Chriſt are thus in union? And then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. What benefit and income have I by being united unto Chriſt? For ſo the Text
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169783:52"/> imports it by way of triumph, benefit and bleſſing to that ſoul which is one Spirit with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And in all theſe three Conſiderations, I am not to ſpeak of the <hi>Maximum quod ſic,</hi> or the <hi>Minimum quod ſic;</hi> Not of the Degrees of believing: knowing that the leaſt <hi>grain of faith</hi> doth as truly unite to Chriſt, as the <hi>Plerophoria</hi> faith of aſſurance, though not ſo ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How may a believing ſoul and Chriſt be ſaid to be one Spirit? I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this in ſome few and brief par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This will appear in the life of Chriſt, and the life of a Believer. Take a Believer in his birth and progreſs in this world, in his firſt and in his laſt, and ſtill you will find Chriſt and Believers walking hand in hand, and heart in heart; they do not only cloſe together in the final cloſe, but through Chriſt their whole life is a harmony, joying and joyning and rejoycing in one another. True it is, as Muſitians may have in their Deſcant ſome <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>flats,</hi> ſome <hi>reſts</hi> and <hi>pauſes,</hi> yet even they ſet out the harmony: So a Believer may have ſome withdrawings of divine light, Chriſt may ſeem to ſtand behind the wall and to be eſtranged; but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169783:52"/> no ſooner doth Chriſt call, but ſtraight ſaith the holy ſoul, <hi>Draw me, and I will run after thee,</hi> Can. 1. 4. And if the Saint cries, <hi>I am my Welbeloveds,</hi> Chriſt ſaith preſently, <hi>She is his,</hi> Can. 2. 16.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe as Chriſt and the ſoul have an union in life, ſo have they alſo in death and ſuffering: If they ſuffer, he ſuffers; if he ſuffers, they ſuffer; if Chriſt dies, the Saints die; yea count, reckon your ſelves ſo, ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6. 11. yet with this difference; Chriſt dyeth for ſin, the Saints to ſin. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus non filius fuit irae ſub ira;</hi> Chriſt was not a Son of wrath, though under wrath. But we were both; and yet what we had done, Chriſt counts himſelf had done, and ſtands in our ſtead. So that as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was the greateſt ſinner in the world.</hi> And he bids the Saints believe that all their ſins were laid on him; and that not only ſo, but that his righteouſneſs is made ours; for ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>He is the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. And if we be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, Chriſt is afflicted; he having the ſame <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 9</note> ſpirit of ſympathizing, muſt needs have the ſame ſpirit in ſuffering. Out of this ſenſe, if Chriſt be bound and led to Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary</hi> to ſuffer for his Saints, ſaith the holy Soul, <hi>I am not only ready to be bound, but</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:169783:53"/> 
                  <hi>to die for the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Act. 21. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are one Spirit with Chriſt, by having communion and intereſt in all the precious graces of Chriſt. This is the Saints teſtimony, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit:</hi> which Spirit is the ſweet fruit of all the graces dwelling in our hearts, and by which we cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father.</p>
               <p>And if you would know what this Spirit of Grace is, the Apoſtle tels you, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to the worlds envyings, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21, 22. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Be not proud of this thy Spiritual income; but be joyfull, and be chearfull; for againſt ſuch there is no law. Why no law againſt ſuch? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. So then if we rank up all theſe graces, Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. theſe being one Spirit with Chriſt, we by being in union with Chriſt, have a communion with all the graces of Chriſt. Thus Chriſt dwels in us by faith, and we are in Chriſt by faith: Chriſt dwels in us by love, and we dwell in Chriſt by love; only
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169783:53"/> 
                  <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> So that though we be many members, and have diverſity of gifts, and ſeveral operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet but one ſpirit, one body, one hope of our calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm, one God and father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, believers are one ſpirit with Chriſt, in that they leave all other relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in coming to Chriſt: If any thing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, tribulation, peril, ſword, father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, friends, a believer will through thick and thin, croſs or comforts, good report or bad report, through all to Chriſt: How is man and wife one fleſh? by leaving all to be joyned to one another, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave father and mother, and ſhall cleave to his wife, and they ſhall be one fleſh:</hi> Thus is it in the ſpiritual union between Chriſt and the ſoul, they leave all for Chriſt: And this is but that which Chriſt hath done for us; for he left Glory, Father, Houſe and Home, <hi>Phil</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Let this minde be in you, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Chriſt Jeſus, who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God; but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant;</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:169783:54"/> 
                  <hi>yea, he was made in the likeneſs of men, and humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death:</hi> And what was all this for, but that his Saints might be joyned unto him in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in righteouſneſs, in life, in grace, in glory? Chriſt left all for us, that we might have a union with him; ſo we muſt leave all other relations, and cleave unto Chriſt alone. And therefore let us put the queſtion unto conſcience, How many of us can part and leave all for Chriſt? if we finde not this reſolution within us, but we have a cleaving to father and mother, to this worlds comforts and enjoyments, profeſs what we will for Chriſt, yet ſo far as thy reſolution fails thee of leaving all for Chriſt, ſo far is my fear of thee, that thou art not in union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To be one ſpirit with Chriſt, doth denote the conſtancy and perpetual tye that is between Chriſt and the ſoul: No knot will be laſting and holding, but this between Chriſt and believers. Couple our ſelves to fleſh never ſo ſtrongly, yet all will be broken; couple our ſelves to ſin never ſo ſtrongly, <hi>This ſhall you have of Gods hand, ye ſhall lie down in ſorrow;</hi> your vanity ſhall be bound up in vexation of ſpirit. No conjunction can hold, but that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169783:54"/> which is ſpiritual; nor no ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, but that which is between Chriſt and believers. Sin will make a ſeparation; though God be thy Creator, Preſerver, theſe knots between the Creature and God will all be broken: But this union with Chriſt and our ſpirits, it is a conſtant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and an everlaſting holding. I have read of one, that writing to his Conſort, would uſe this ſalutation, <hi>Eternal thine:</hi> This was an expreſſion of exceſs, that can never be made good to any but Chriſt and believers; and therefore for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, thou doubting believer, Chriſt and thee being one ſpirit, bear up the head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all temptations; for thy head and husband ſalutes thee with <hi>Eternal thine,</hi> Jer. 31. 3. <hi>The Lord hath appeared unto me, ſaying, I have loved thee with an everlaſting love.</hi> A love that is both bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and endleſs; with ſuch a love hath Chriſt loved his Church and people; <hi>And therefore though all fails,</hi> as it will, fleſh and heart, and all will fail, <hi>yet this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual union between Chriſt and the ſoul ſhall never fail,</hi> Rom. 8. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all theſe into one; <hi>Tribulation, diſtreſs, famine, perſecution, peril, ſword, life, angels, principalities, powers, things preſent, things</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:169783:55"/> 
                  <hi>to come;</hi> now follows your triumph, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Touching Evidence whether we be one Spirit with Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="2">2. THe next thing to be toucht upon, is, <hi>What Evidence may I have, that Chriſt and my ſoul are one in this ſpiritual union?</hi> For this is very conſiderable, before we can draw any ſaving and ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the benefits and ſpiritual Incomes the ſoul hath by being one Spirit with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As an Evidence for this union, try your union with Chriſt by your communion with Chriſt. Not that you ſhould meaſure out your union by your communion; for it is poſſible for the ſoul to be united unto Chriſt, that as yet hath no acquaintance and familiarity with Chriſt. As <hi>Mary</hi> did, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 15. talk with Chriſt, as well as believe in Chriſt, and yet ſhe did not know him; and why might not ſhe have ſuppoſed him to be Chriſt, as well as the <hi>Gardiner?</hi> Therefore let us not <hi>meaſure our union</hi> with Chriſt by our communion, but let us <hi>try our union</hi> by our communion and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:169783:56"/>
               <p> Can thy ſoul ſay from experience, as the Spouſe, <hi>Can.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>He brought me into the banqueting houſe, and his Banner over me was love.</hi> Without queſtion ſo was <hi>houſe</hi> and <hi>table,</hi> and all. Hath thy ſovl ever been fed with his dainties? have you been at his table, taſted of his wine? It may be thou wilt ſay, This I know, that Chriſt hath ſtood <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 20.</note> at my door, and knockt at my heart, as he doth at many a Sinners in a Sermon. But when was the time that Chriſt came in and <hi>ſupped with thee?</hi> and when did you <hi>ſup with him?</hi> What inward feaſtings and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity hath there been between Chriſt and the ſoul? We know the tie of Nature will conſtrain ſome exchanges and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of love between man and wife; but much more the band of Grace between the ſoul and Chriſt. Try therefore thy <hi>union</hi> by thy <hi>communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would know your Union, try not only by your Communion, but alſo by Convincement: as Communion is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſo Convincement.</p>
               <p>We know that there can be no true mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, without convincement of love: No more can there be between Chriſt and thy ſoul. Now, when was thy ſoul convinced of Chriſts alſufficiencie, and thy ſelf of thy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169783:57"/> own natural miſery? For this is the way Chriſt takes to wooe and win the ſoul unto himſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that have union with Chriſt, flie the pollutions of the world. None can be one with Chriſt, and one with Swearing, one with Drunkenneſs: not one with Chriſt, and one with Covetouſneſs. In ſuch pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there is not communion with Chriſt, and therefore no union; For <hi>what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hath light with darkneſs, Chriſt with Belial?</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt clears the heart of ſuch gueſts as drive a trade with ſin. And would to God I might ſay of all you Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of many of theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They that are one with Chriſt, do mind the things of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>They that are after the Spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit;</hi> that is, All their thoughts, words, works, projects and contrivances do habitually fix and center in Chriſt. Try therefore which way thy thoughts, thy projects run: If they meet in Chriſt, then from theſe and ſuch like Evidences drink down thy ſpiritual comforts; for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169783:57"/> from our union with Chriſt flow ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual incomes, even benefits enough to hold up the heart in the worſt of outward croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, loſſes, perſecution, trial, troubles what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

               </argument>
               <p>FIrſt, All the precious Promiſes are yours, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſe of this life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> True Godlineſs cannot be without union with Chriſt; and (poor Creatures) it is very certain that this life will not make thee happy. But now if another will, if a Jeſus and Eternal Glory will, you have this riches promiſed in that life that is to come. This life that now is, is indeed to make you gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and in it you have a rich promiſe of comfort, <hi>Joh</hi> 4. 18. <hi>I will not leave you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs, I will be with you to the end of the world.</hi> A precious Jeſus in a precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is enough to bear up the ſoul in all temptations. What though thou art poor
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169783:58"/> perſonally? if Chriſt be one with thee ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, thou haſt a plenty in the midſt of all thy poverty. <hi>The Lord is a ſun and a ſhield;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 84. 11.</note> yea, <hi>he will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them</hi> that are Believers. What ſaith the Apoſtle for the chearing of thy ſpirit? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes.</hi> What wilt thou deſire more? If promiſes that are precious, if promiſes that are great, if exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes will do thee good, they are all thine, if thou haſt union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the richeſt Graces are ours, from the leaſt of <hi>Faith</hi> to the fulneſs of <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Gods <hi>graciouſneſs</hi> is the richeſt and ſupereminenteſt grace: And it may be for the preſent thou haſt but a grain or a drop of that Ocean; but know, the whole Sea of love is all thine. It may be thou goeſt weeping, notwithſtanding thou beareſt <note place="margin">Pſ. 126. 6.</note> precious ſeed; yet know thy ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is <hi>ſheafs of joy,</hi> yea <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> At preſent thou haſt by union with Chriſt no leſs then Riches of grace and Gracious riches; nay, but Exceeding riches of Grace is all yours, if you be Chriſts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All the ſweeteſt Comforts are yours,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169783:58"/> if you have union with Chriſt. I cannot ſay all earthly Comforts, but rather Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the ſweeteſt and heavenly Comforts are yours; and the very thought of this ſhould ſwallow up ten thouſand Croſſes, how much more the poſſeſſion? Yet this is the fault of Chriſtians; one little trouble or Affliction ſwallows up abundance of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; whereas one thought of Chriſt, and one enjoyment from him ſhould ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up abundance of afflictions. What will not peace of Conſcience bring, which is a continual feaſt unto the ſoul, by Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thine? And if Joy in the Holy Ghoſt may comfort thee, that is thine: If <hi>wine refined,</hi> if <hi>wine and milk,</hi> if <hi>water of life,</hi> if the Spring of all comfort may comfort thee, it is yours, if you be married to Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed be God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort.</hi> And leſt the ſoul ſhould think to have him thus only in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he adds, that he is a God of comfort for you on Earth, <hi>to comfort you in all your tribulation;</hi> that we may be able to ſuccour, ſupport, and comfort others, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts wherewith he comforteth us. And what a precious Income is this, to have by Chriſt all heavenly, ſweet, and precious comforts!</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:169783:59"/> 4. By union with Chriſt, all the higheſt Priviledges are yours. If it was a priviledge to be called the <hi>Son of Pharaohs daughter:</hi> what a high priviledge is it to be ſons and daughters of the moſt high God? and thus thou art by being united unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What a priviledge is it to be born an Heir unto ſome Great man on earth? What honour and homage will men give to Heirs upon this account! But by this union with Chriſt thou art an Heir to God, and Coheir with Chriſt. 'Tis true, thou waſt not born to it; but every Believer was bought into this eminent, high, and noble priviledge. And if we do but conſider the price, it may ſuffice to ſet forth this priviledge. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Ye were not redeemed with ſilver or gold, but with the precious blood of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be thou art poor; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Great men upon Earth will ſcorn to cal thee Friend, Brother, Siſter, Son, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: many are ſo proud, that in thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty they wil be aſhamed to own thee. But thou haſt this priviledge in being joyned to Chriſt, that the <hi>Lord of all</hi> is not aſhamed to call you Brethren, Sons, Daughters, Friends: nay, you that are joyned to Chriſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169783:59"/> are Gods <hi>jewels.</hi> Joh. 1. 12. <hi>To as many as</hi>

                  <hi>believed to them he gave power to become the ſons of God.</hi> And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>For this cauſe he is not aſhamed to call us Brethren.</hi> For what cauſe? The verſe before tels you; becauſe of union thou haſt this priviledge: <hi>He that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified are both one; for this cauſe he is not aſhamed to call us bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3: What a priviledge is it counted to be free of ſome Corporations, as to be a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>London</hi> and ſuch like Cities? And <hi>Paul</hi> tels you it was his priviledge to be free-born. But now the Saints of God, by being united unto Chriſt, are made free of that <hi>new Ieruſalem,</hi> which is Heaven it ſelf. Chriſt hath inroll'd his Saints in the book of life; all your names are written and enrolled in Heaven, and you are Citizens by vertue of your union. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What a priviledge is it to be freed from all Arreſts? Mens perſons count this a great priviledge. But what is it to have the ſoul free; and to have it ſo free, that it ſhall be free indeed? Such a priviledge have Saints by Chriſt: he by marrying them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, hath made them free, free indeed from all arreſts, <hi>No condemnation to them that are in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:169783:60"/>
               <p> It would be well, if wicked men that have no intereſt in Chriſt, could bribe Satan, Death and Hell, and at the great day of Judgment come off from their arreſts: but that is impoſſible; but if they could, Conſcience will riſe in judgment againſt them, and iſſue out a greater Writ then that of <hi>Belſhazar</hi> upon the wall.</p>
               <p>But now Believers are free by vertue of Chriſt; having this priviledge, that none ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect; <hi>for Chriſt hath dyed, and alſo is riſen</hi>

                  <hi>again,</hi> who will not ſuffer them to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be touched or attached, but deliver them out of all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That ſoul that hath union with Chriſt, hath not only ſuch an Income as all the <hi>precious Promiſes, all the richeſt Graces, all the ſweeteſt Comforts, all the higheſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> but alſo all the <hi>nobleſt Hopes</hi> are yours, if you be Chriſts. What a noble hope is that, which a gloriovs Chriſt gives unto every gracious heart? <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Which is Chriſt in us the hope of Glory.</hi> This <hi>hope</hi> is a myſterie, yea a glorious myſterie; yea there is riches of glory in this myſterie. By union with Chriſt this is our ſpiritual Income, <hi>Chriſt is in that ſoul the hope of glory.</hi> True it is, that <hi>if in this life we had only hope, we</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:169783:60"/> 
                  <hi>were of all men moſt miſerable:</hi> as the hope of wicked men is, who make <hi>gold their hope,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job 31. 24.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks. But ſaith the ſoul, I have not thirſted after ſuch baſe and earthly hopes as this worlds good, or this worlds gold; but Heaven, and God, and Grace, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea the nobleſt hopes, <hi>Chriſt in my ſoul the hope of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, not only the nobleſt hopes are thine by being one with Chriſt, but all heavenly enjoyments are thine by vertue of thy union. And this is ſo large an Income, that Saints and Angels cannot expreſs: <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, neither hath ear heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for ſuch that are in union with Chriſt.</hi> Heaven, and all Heavens enjoyments; Chriſt, and God, and Glory; a glorious God, a glorious Chriſt, a glorious Glory. I can ſay no more; All is promiſed, and all ſhall be accompliſht. Saints united to Chriſt have all <hi>theirs; and they are Chriſts,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 23.</p>
               <p>And out of all that hath been ſaid, I ſhall adde but a word by way of uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unbeliever, come forth, and behold the Income of the Saints, and with a holy emulation enquire what is thy portion:

And what muſt I have? Tell thy ſoul with ſadneſs, If thou art out of this ſpiritual union with Chriſt, then all the fearful Threatnings, all the heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Vials of Gods wrath, with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgments and everlaſting torment, is all yours, if you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not in Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new creature.

                  <hi>you ſay, unto them, Depart in peace, be you warmed, and filled; notwithſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?</hi> the meaning is, have as many good words as you will, yet if you have not practice in a meaſure ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto your expreſſions, you are alone, your faith is but a dead faith: words, though never ſo ſweet, without works, are but as a ſounding braſs, and a tinkling ſymbal.</p>
               <p>From the ſcope, this will be very clear, <hi>That common profeſſion without ſpiritual operation, will deceive;</hi> and therefore <hi>James</hi> ſeems to be zealous againſt ſuch that have a great deal of name, but not the nature of true ſerving of God. Saith he Verſe 18. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works:</hi> you all boaſt of believing, from profeſſing; but the rule is, <hi>Shew me faith by thy workings;</hi> not from thy boaſtings or pofeſſings: You profeſs, and you boaſt of faith and your profeſsion; I muſt tell you who hath faith too; them whom thou knoweſt are damn'd; they whom thou thinkeſt ſcorn to be compared with; yet know, the devils and damned ſpirits do believe: <hi>Thou believeſt there is one God; the Devils alſo do believe and tremble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we may plainly collect, that the Text holds out a parity and diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169783:64"/> the common faith of the world, and the faith of devils; what the wicked men of the world take in at large, through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, birth or education, the devils alſo may do as much. Man believes there is a God, ſo do the devils too; the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that God is one, the devils believe ſo alſo. There is a faith that doth believe all to be true that God hath made or done, and laid down in his word, <hi>ſed abſque fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> but without truſting: and this ſort of faith is not onely common to the world, and man, but alſo to the damned ſpirits: And this in the ſum of it, is properly called <hi>Hiſtorical faith:</hi> which ſort of faith, I fear is that which moſt of profeſſos are fraught withal; which ſort of faith, is the faith men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Text. Moſt men have faith of this kinde; thus moſt believe, ſo doth the devil; nay, the Apoſtle addes, that the devil doth ſomething more; in a ſort he outſtrips man in that he knows; he alſo is afraid; the devil believes Gods ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, power, wrath, juſtice, judgement, and he akes and quakes at it; Man alſo believes as much, but he is hardened, bold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious: Gods power, word, works, fear not man, whilſt the devil ſhakes and trembles at it: Therefore we may collect, That man
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169783:64"/> in ſome things hath an exceſs, even of the devils; for though the devil cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the word, yet without the word he is convinced: Gods power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his works fear Satan, and afright him, whilſt man is bold and incorrigible; the devil ſtoops and fears; whilſt man is ſtubborn, the devil trembles: And thus much for the ſcope of the words.</p>
               <p>I ſhall draw that which I intend from them, into this Theſis or Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and I conceive it to be no more then what the Text affords.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Before I take the doctrine aſunder, let me ſay thus much in the general, that many that own God by outward profeſsion, and many that own the devil in a deviliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, muſt not think it ſtrange to own him in this doctrine; for it is a truth, if we compare but this Scripture to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Profeſſion. In that of <hi>John</hi> 8. 41, 43, 44. the Phariſees were very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in outward profeſſion; and you may ſee their own confeſſion in the 41 Verſe, <hi>We have one father, even God;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, they wanted love to God and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169783:65"/> Chriſt; So the verſe following ſpeaks, <hi>If God were your father, as you profeſs he is, and that but one;</hi> yet let me tell you not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this your ſeeming glory, <hi>you are of your father the devil, accurſed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſons of a lye, and his works you do, and will;</hi> and this is not ſo ſtrange as true, if the judgement of Chriſt may ſtand upon theſe ſeeming Saints.</p>
               <p>And the judgement of the Apoſtle is the ſame in the Text; they did profeſs for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and yet he parallels their profeſſion to the devils: <hi>You believe there is one God, ſo do the devils:</hi> And let me ſay to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in name, even in our times, who can boaſt of promiſes and vows, and renouncing of the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world: know for all theſe outward priviledges, your ſeeming ſanctity, and outward profeſſion, yet your practice falls ſo ſhort, that ſince nothing will make you ſerious, and truly fearing, and truly believing. I will give you an inſtance which might make you all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; however to be aſhamed; for it will be found, that wicked man is more incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible then the very devils; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all your profeſſion, yet take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this example; for though there be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169783:65"/> ſome that deny the faith; yet amongſt them that do profeſs the faith, they ſtand in their profeſſion but in computation with the devil; fot though <hi>thou believeſt there is one God, the devils alſo do believe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THat there is a devil: Note ſuch that are ſo curious and incorrigible, that there is a principality, and a power, a prince of the ayr; and you need not ſeek far; for he rules in the hearts of wicked men, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>The ſpirit that now works in the children of diſobedience, he wrought in the Apoſtles time;</hi> but more now by ſuch inquirings: And know, though he cannot compaſs the heavens, yet he doth the earth; <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6, 7. <hi>Now there was a day when the ſons of God came to preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and Satan came alſo among them: And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, Whence comeſt thou? Then Satan anſwered the Lord and ſaid, From going to and fro in the earth:</hi> And if this anſwer, and the Text anſwers thee not, take heed thou art not poſſeſt; for though Satan is not able to compaſs heaven, yet he can the earth; he may tempt in Paradiſe, but not in heaven: And <hi>Adam</hi> fell by ſuch inquiries; and they that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus Gods works made, want but one ſtep higher to queſtion God himſelf the maker.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:169783:66"/>
               <p> What was he that tempted Chriſt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> found him to his coſt; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> found him to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conqueſt, though to his own croſs; in both was fulfilled that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15 <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel:</hi> This did Chriſt accompliſh over ſin and Satan. And ſhall any be ſo bold as now to queſtion? rather tremble, then thus tempt; taking that councel of rejoycing, not inquiring, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 18, 19, 20. <hi>I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in this rejoyce not;</hi> but know it is a truth; and if your names be not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven, your terror too—If Chriſt tell thee he beheld him, thou needs not queſtion further for to ſee him: Be but acquainted with thy own heart, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion thou mayeſt feel him in ſuch temptations that is common to man. Chriſt indeed brought Satan by his death into a narrower compaſs then he was before; <hi>For</hi>

                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>we were all children of wrath as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> but now this devourer cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Chriſts ſaints and ſervants, though he ſeeks it continually: And ask the ſaints, and they will tell you, they are ſenſible of the wiles of Satan; but deſire from their hearts no familiarity, no queſtionings, for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169783:67"/> that brings complainings; no reaſonings, for fear of overcomings; not any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the Lords ſuſtainings.</p>
               <p>But that the Devil is an Angelical crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that hath both power and policy; conſider but theſe Scriptures:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Devil is an Angelical creature, obſerve but 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. And no marvel; for Satan himſelf is transformed <note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 1</note> into an Angel of light: And then that he is powerful, the Text tells you, <hi>He can transform himſelf:</hi> And you need not doubt but the devil is a notable Polititian, a ſubtile deceiver; for he is call'd <hi>An Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the brethren, ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8. But to put you out of doubt, there is not onely a devil, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in the plural: there is not onely a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but a kingdom of damned ſpirits; not onely that Leviathan, Lucifer the great, but he hath a multitude of Emiſſaries; and therefore let us daily and continually [the devils do ſurround us] take heed they do not poſſeſs us; he is very vigilant to enter, to come without ſending for, and inquiring after: And uſually he brings a multitude; as one ſin, ſo one devil, hardly comes or goes alone. <hi>We are many;</hi> take their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 9.—And we had all

How was <hi>Job</hi> vexed, <hi>Paul</hi> buffeted? And if you that are ſo curious on ſuchin quiries would know, why there is ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſpirits and places; let me but ask you, what did God make you for? I know you muſt needs ſay, To ſerve him; and therefore know, for thy diſobedience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleneſs and inquiries was the devil thrown down; and if thou thus followeſt his motions and temptations, thou wilt <hi>without queſtion</hi> have part with him, and his Angels in torments everlaſting; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not a deſtroyer and a tormentor of thy ſelf: Be not wicked nor wilful, be not over wiſe, nor over curious; for by ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation the devil became a devil, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 6. <hi>For the Angels which kept not their firſt ſtation, but left their own habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting chains, under darkneſs, unto the judgement of the great day:</hi> It ſeems the devil became a devil, by prying into things that were too high for him, which cannot be commended in us creatures, when ſo condemned in Angels. <hi>David</hi> keeps within his ſphaere, and ſo let us; <hi>He would not exerciſe himſelf in things that were too high;</hi> and why ſhould we? for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169783:68"/> this is the fruits of ſuch enquiries: the evil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were Angels of light, but now of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hell and torment; God for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious ſpeculation, threw them out of heaven; and the devil by his ſubtily threw thee out of Paradiſe: Take heed that for obeying this devil, the Lord throw thee not into hell; <hi>Verily thou wilt not come thence, until thou haſt paid the utmoſt farthing,</hi>

                  <p>Proving that the Devil doth believe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="2">2. AS there is a Devil, ſo the Devils do believe. The tempting ſpirits that daily do ſurround us, have an hiſtorical faith; yea, and more too, a miraculous faith: What means thoſe expreſſions, <hi>of caſting out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by the Prince of devils?</hi> Mat. 12. 27. They believe that God is the onely Soveraign, Omniſcient, Powerful, Infinite; and alſo they believe their own damnation certain; upon this ground they ſpight, and ſpleen,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169783:68"/> and envy Gods Elect, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your adverſary the devil as a roaring lyon walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour:</hi> What a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of devils have we ſtill ſeeking and aſſaulting, ſpighting and ſpleening the ſaints and ſervants of God? and therefore gives the Apoſtle unto us this councel, <hi>Be ye ſober and vigilant, Reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith; Watch over your ſelves; for the devil watches for your ſouls, he ſeeks how he may devour:</hi> It is manifeſt that the devil owned the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to Chriſt, that ſome now adays fear not to deny, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down,</hi> Scriptum eſt, <hi>for it is written,</hi> Pſal. 91. 11. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways:</hi> The devil in this quotation owns both God the Father, and Chriſt the Son: And this he alleages learnedly and readily, though very fallaciouſly, leaving out that that made againſt himſelf; for it was written, <hi>He ſhould not tempt the Lord his God;</hi> and ſuppoſes that which in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage he takes for granted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>And they cryed out, and ſaid, What have we to do with thee Jeſus thou Son of God? art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> Mark, the devils believe ſo much,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169783:69"/> that he doth not onely reckon Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and torments, but he caſts up the time too; though the devil wil be tempting at all times, yet counts not to be tormented before his time.</p>
               <p>And if you would know the ground of this, Why the devil doth believe, I ſhall anſwer in a word, Becauſe he may accuſe ſuch enquirers, that are not true believers at the laſt day. The devil is called <hi>The Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> Rev. 12. 12. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Rejoyce ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them; wo to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the ſea; for the devil is come down unto you, for he knoweth his time is but ſhort; And what ſaith the 10 Verſe? <hi>For the Accuſer of the Brethren is caſt down, which accuſed them before our God day and night:</hi> And if he be thus bold with Saints? what will he not caſt in againſt common Profeſſors? You may read how bold he was with <hi>Job,</hi> but ſurely he will be more bold <note place="margin">Job. 1. 2.</note> againſt pretenders to truth and faith at the laſt day, before the judgement-ſeat of God; ſo that I may very well reverſe that ſaying of Chriſt to wicked men, <hi>Think you that the Law, and God, and conſcience will onely accuſe you: there is one, even the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, he will accuſe you;</hi> I cannot ſay, in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169783:69"/> whom you truſt, but to whom you practice, whoſe faith &amp; your faith are parallels: thou believeſt there is one God, thou art not without a fellow, though a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, <hi>The devils do believe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks I hear a moral common profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, who hath the faith of the ſtate, or of the Pariſh, ſtand at Gods tribunal pleading, as they in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Lord, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?</hi> So in that day will many plead, at leaſt in theſe days, they think ſuch pleadings will ſerve the turn; Was not I born of Chriſtian Parents, Baptized into ſuch a faith, lived all my life time under ſuch a Miniſtry, profeſſed the Goſpel of Chriſt, as the reſt of my friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors did, believed the word of God, and do verily believe it is a truth, from the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the laſt of the <hi>Revelation?</hi> And who can [conſidering this] once doubt of my eternal welfare? But know, that notwithſtanding all this, thou wilt ſurely miſs of it; for if thou haſt no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plea, Satan will come in againſt thee, ſaying, Thus, If this man, and this woman may have ſalvation on ſuch terms as theſe,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169783:70"/> why may not I? I was no common drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an adulterer; I have known the Scriptures from firſt to laſt; yea, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt and profeſt the common Hiſtorical faith in all ages; yea, I have been as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light in all forms, and through all times: And yet notwithſtanding my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and my profeſſion, I muſt have no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, for I look for none; and why ſhould this perſon, or that perſon have any more favor then I, who had but like faith as I? Common profeſſors, in the fear of him whom you do profeſs, if ever you look for favor in that day, do not flatter and deceive your own ſouls, by thinking <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> for a man may be a Goſpel-profeſſor; yea, a believer of God, his Word, his Truth, and yet ſo unſound in the faith, that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may be his, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not, ye workers of iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7. 23.</p>

               <p n="3">3. AS the Devils have an Hiſtorical faith, they do believe; ſo <hi>moſt mens faith is no better then the faith of devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the proof of this, I need carry your thoughts no further then the Text; for mark, <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God,</hi> that is at large, and in common, as moſt of the world do; <hi>Have a name to live, but are dead:</hi> A prophane life, and a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, makes all thy profeſſion vain and fruitleſs; as the verſe following the Text clearly tells you, <hi>Faith without works is fruitleſs;</hi> and for all thy glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, thou art but a vain man; ſo ſaith the text, <hi>But thou wilt know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</hi> for though the devil believes to a baſe end, and thou ſayeſt thou haſt faith to a pretended good end; yet if thou attaineſt it not, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof haſt eternal torment, what art thou the better? nay rather, how much art thou the worſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that run in a race, run all; but one</hi>

                  <hi>receiveth the prize;</hi> So many are runners by common profeſſion; but it is the ſaving faith onely that obtains; it is not a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, but the enjoying of Chriſt, and living and loving of Chriſt, that puts into a true account beyond the devil.</p>
               <p>But doth not the Text put a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Thou haſt a large profeſſion; ſo hath the devil, he hath ſeemings as well as men have; and therefore he is ſaid <hi>To transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be an Angel of light;</hi> and when he doth thus, he is moſt a devil: So when a man profeſſes for God, but inwardly acts for Satan, what is he better? if ſeemings be good in Satan, it is good in wicked men;

               <p>Some do make a threefold difference in believing; A believing of God, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <note place="margin">De Deo, Deo, &amp; in Deum.</note> to God, and a believing in God: But aſſure thy ſoul, nothing but ſaving faith, Chriſt being in thee, and Chriſt

               <p>And if nothing elſe, what will it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit me, if I have the faith of the times, and faith of wonders; yea, and all knowledge, of which latter the devil hath abundance? ſurely no more then he that gains the world, but yet loſes his ſoul; a miſerable and wretched bargain.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Sheweth wherein the belief of common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and the belief of devils, agree, and diſagree.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shall begin with the diſparity, unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or diſagreement betwixt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith of men, and the faith of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
               <p>The firſt difference lieth in this, that the devils are without hope, but common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are not; the devil knows himſelf to be reprobated, never to be approved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but man thinks he ſhall: And I will not ſay otherwiſe; ſo long as there is life, there is hope; but take heed this hope make thee not aſhamed through a falſe faith: Lay hold therefore of preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, ſtudy to be approved. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſaith <hi>Jude,</hi> Verſe 6. <hi>Are reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgement of the great day:</hi> Many there be that live without God in the world, but pretend to have faith; the devil hath faith too: the Text tells you, <hi>He doth believe;</hi> but he doth not ſay, he hopes; and our uſual ſaying is, <hi>If it were not for hope, the</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:169783:73"/> 
                  <hi>heart would break:</hi> And know aſſuredly, that without ſpiritual hope, thy ſoul will everlaſtingly periſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the devils do believe, yet they can have no repentance: But man in his falſe faith may be ſaid to have ſome ſort of repentance. Faith ſometimes, as it is taken for knowledge, may check the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. A common profeſſor may have flaſhings and ſorrowings, as <hi>Judas</hi> had, who was a profeſt diſciple of Chriſt: But this ſort of repentance profits no more then his faith, which onely makes a gilded outſide; like the powder in the pan of the musket, it often fires, but will not go off: So they that have common faith, may often fire, but never go off to mortification, becauſe all their faith is but the fruits of the fleſh, but not the fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But now this ſort of repentance the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cannot have; but he is ſeared and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though <hi>James</hi> tells you he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it is poſſible for man to finde repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but the devil cannot.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The difference between the common faith of profeſſors, and the faith of devils <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 11.</note> is in this; man may believe a ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a lye, that is in the devil the father of lyes: How many are there in the world
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169783:73"/> that hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs? makes no queſtion to have happineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs; make no queſtion to be ſaved, but makes no conſcience? What a ſtrong deluſion is this? that while the devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves things certainly, and man believes the devil tempts to make him miſerable, and yields unto all his corruptions, and yet makes no doubt to be happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus for the diſparity betwixt the common faith of men and the faith of devils.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take alſo a word wherein the belief of men and devils hath a kinde of likeneſs and agreement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Devils beleive Gods ſoveraignty, as well as moſt men. God is powerful, infinite, able, ſaith the common profeſſor; this will the devil acknowledge too; man believes that God is unity; ſo doth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: thus the text is expreſs, <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God;</hi> this harmony of faith have the Devils, <hi>They believe this and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Man believes the Scriptures to be the word of God; that is, thou art a common profeſſor, and thou aſſenteſt unto this, that God is true, and that the Scriptures are the written word of God, and all thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages therein contained; as of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169783:74"/> Creation, Redemption from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah;</hi> from <hi>Noah to David;</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to Chriſt; from Chriſt to the ſeveral tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Apoſtles; yea, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt this very text to be a truth; Why all this and much more may it be ſaid that the Devils do believe: that they do believe the hiſtory of the word, and ſomething of the myſtery of it, may clearly be gathered from his tempting of Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grant that thou doeſt believe that Jeſus Chriſt dyed to ſave ſinners; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil believes this too, becauſe he ſeeks the deſtruction of ſouls: And ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> It ſeems the Devil made cloſe work with the hearts of men, that none but Chriſt could ſave; the devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, mends his pace to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Grant therefore that thou haſt not onely a hiſtorical faith, but alſo a temporary faith; thou followeſt the times wherein thou liveſt in, believing according to the Doctrine and Cuſtom; may be thou riſeſt high in thy notion, and profeſſeſt the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and choiceſt things; yet know, thou ſtil mayeſt not be ſaid to believe, more then
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169783:74"/> what the devil may be ſaid to believe; for without queſtion he follows the faſhion, and ſuits himſelf to the faith of the times in all ages; he tempts under the Law, as under the Goſpel; and as the time grows ſhorter, and his kingdom weaker; ſo the Devil is more ſtrong, and more ſubtil: this may be cleared from that of <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>The Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath;</hi> that is, in the days of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, more eſpecially at the end of the world the Devil beſtirs himſelf, having great wrath; and what is the reaſon? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows he hath but a ſhort time; the devil knows that happineſs, and a crown of glory is laid up for the Saints; and that judgement and torment is for himſelf, and for all his ſervants; upon this knowledge he rages moſt in the laſt times. Thus much for the third thing to be opened; before I ſpeak to the laſt, ſuffer ſomething by way of Uſe and Application.</p>

                  <p>Containing ſomething by way of Application from the firſt branch in the Doctrine.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF it be ſo, that the belief of moſt men is no better then the belief of the damned, then let us fall to ſerious examination of every one of our own hearts, what our faith and profeſſion is.</p>
               <p>This is matter of great concerment; and the moſt ſubject to ſelf-couſenage: Men will believe no further then moſt believe; and moſt believe no otherwiſe then the Devils believe. Search and examine what faith you have: for this is a truth from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, That the Devils do profeſs as well as men: and that moſt mens belief is not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Devils. Say then to your own hearts, as the Diſciples to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 23. when Chriſt told the Diſciples that one of them ſhould betray him, they preſently put the queſtion, ſaying, <hi>Maſter, Is it I?</hi> So ſay of a truth, moſt mens profeſſion is no better then what the Devils have; and what is mine amongſt the multitude of Profeſſors? Give unto the Lord a ground of that hope that is in you; for he cals for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169783:75"/> it by vertue of this truth: <hi>Come in thou Creature; for I have given you rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons.</hi> Come, ſpeak thou common Profeſſor: Thou makeſt thy boaſt of God, ſaying, thou doſt believe; but know, ſo do the Devils: thou feareſt with a ſlaviſh fear; ſo do the Devils: thou boaſteſt of hiſtorical and temporary faith; but if thou findeſt no more, thou wilt fall ſhort of heaven and happineſs. Thou art as yet but as thoſe fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. that thought to be ſaved by profeſſion; for they went under the notion of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and it is very probable they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical and common faith; for they had <hi>lamps,</hi> but they had not <hi>oyl;</hi> they had not the fruits of the Spirit, and therefore could have no entrance. Examine therefore what thy faith is; for moſt go for Virgins, that have a name to live by common profeſſion; but an evil and an adulterous generation are ſuch that have not the ſigns and ſeals of the righteouſneſs of faith, which is only by Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You that content your ſelves with this common belief of men, know your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. What though thou haſt gotten ten thouſand Notions? yet if thou wanteſt the fruits of the Spirit of Grace, which is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169783:76"/> ſaving Faith within thy heart, thou art yet but in thy unregenerate eſtate, and thou ſitteſt but in the ſame form with the Devil: he is the firſt in wrath, becauſe he is thy father; but thou art as yet no better then a child of wrath, becauſe thou art not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten again by a lively faith, a faith that is active, and full of love and longings after Jeſus Chriſt, who is alone within the ſoul, the <hi>hope of glory.</hi> It may be thou haſt lived thirty, forty, or fifty years: but what Faith haſt thou? It may be thou haſt lived under the teachings of Chriſt, and under the offers of grace, and peace, and reconciliation: this is more then ever the Devil had; and yet he hath as much faith and knowledge as thou haſt, if thou haſt not ſaving, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith: for the Devil hath a faith of Time, and Ages; and if thou haſt not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond him, thou muſt not ſit above him; take heed thou art not thrown down to him, or below him. What the Papiſts ſay of their Church, that men muſt believe as the Church believes; ſo may it be ſaid of the generality of profeſſors, only not by ſuch a neceſſity, but ſuch is moſt mens pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, <hi>That they believe but as the Devil believes:</hi> and in a ſenſe many muſt give place to the Devil even in believing, at
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169783:76"/> leaſtwiſe in obeying. But know, as you are Companions here to believe alike, ſo take notice that without ſaving faith thou muſt live alike in torment. It is very like but that Servant was within the pale of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 45, 46. he had a tongue to ſay, <hi>I am a Believer, and make no queſtion of heaven and happineſs;</hi> but in his heart he ſaid, <hi>My Lord delays his coming.</hi> Here is a profeſſion of one God, as theſe in the text had; yet the Lord of that ſervant may come in an hour, and cut him aſunder, and give him his portion with unbelievers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the common belief of men be no better then the belief of Devils, only in the aforementioned differences, as that the Devil is without hope, without repentance; and both theſe are annexed yet to the life of man from the Bowels of mercy: while it is called <hi>to day,</hi> beg earneſtly at the gate of the bountiful God for mercy and true faith; beg Heaven to cleanſe thy leprous ſoul of luſt and ſin, and to give thee ſaving faith, that thou mayſt outſtrip the Devil before thou dyeſt: For if thou haſt all knowledge, and all faith, ſo that thou couldſt remove mountains, yet all this is nothing, without Chriſt be in your hearts by faith. Say therefore as he doth in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169783:77"/> Goſpel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Lord, I believe; help my unbelief.</hi> I have a common profeſſion; but what will this profit me? The Devils do believe, and yet are the firſt of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: I believe Gods ſoveraignty, that Chriſt dyed for ſinners; yet, <hi>Lord, I believe, help mine unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that this may be from thy heart, conſider theſe few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, what will profeſſion profit thee, if thou attaineſt not the end of it? They that run, if they do not attain, it is no prize, but rather a trouble. Men by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, and not attaining, will come home by <hi>weeping-croſs:</hi> for as there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing due, ſo there will be a heavy loſs, the loſs of Heaven, the loſs of God, his glory, thy own ſalvation. Conſider therefore ſo to run, that you may obtain the end of ſaving faith, which is the ſalvation of your ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou haſt ſins of Commiſſion, that are enough to condemn thee, the leaſt of them being charg'd upon thee; and without faith in Chriſt, all muſt be charged. But yet conſider, if thou couldſt diminiſh ſins of <note place="margin">Io. 3. 19.</note> Commiſſion, what wilt thou do for ſins of Omiſſion? This will be the condemnation, that <hi>light is come into the world, but men</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:169783:77"/> 
                  <hi>love darkneſs more then light.</hi> And becauſe thou didſt not believe, thou didſt not love, thou didſt not ſavour of the grace of God. Conſider thy want, as well as thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: If thou wanteſt a heart-love to Chriſt, in the beſt of all thy profeſſions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, thou art but as a <hi>ſounding braſs,</hi> and as a <hi>tinkling cymbal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider what abundance do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; how few there be that ſhall be ſaved. There is but a <hi>little flock,</hi> that need not to fear the enjoyment of God and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32. but there is a <hi>multitude</hi> that do <hi>profeſs,</hi> that think they ſhall <hi>attain;</hi> but the Devil will as ſoon, becauſe they have not filial fear in their profeſſion, nor <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> the fruit of the Spirit of grace, within their hearts. Compare but that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 22. to the practiſe of the world, and certainly it may make thee look about; <hi>For though the children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the ſea, yet a remnant of them ſhall be ſaved.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> quotes in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. and makes it applicable to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as to the <hi>Jews.</hi> This alſo let Profeſſors now conſider: for though I dare not forbid any to hope, yet I am afraid that through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and National profeſſion moſt will miſcarry.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:169783:78"/> 4. Conſider the character of the laſt times; <hi>There will be but a little Faith, but abundance of Profeſſion.</hi> Every one takes it for granted, that we are in the laſt times; and in thoſe times it's remarkable to have but little <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> but without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion never more <hi>profeſſion;</hi> but it is moſt falſe, and as cold as mens <hi>charity:</hi> which is very ſignificant to be now; for in theſe dayes of ours never was there more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>Chriſt of mercy,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſt of love,</hi> but never more coldneſs and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſhew <hi>works of mercy and love</hi> to one another. And this is no wonder; for when men are wanting to their own ſouls in a lively and ſound <hi>faith,</hi> no marvel they are not wanting unto men in a cold and frozen <hi>charity.</hi> Men love the world more then Chriſt and his members, though they ſeem by profeſſion to have a love to both. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. yet they rather are in darkneſs then in the light, becauſe their hearts are evil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, conſider the deceitfulneſs that is in our own hearts. For what is moſt mens <hi>ſecurity,</hi> but even the name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?</hi> and the heart loves to have it ſo. All is well, thinks the common Profeſſor, if he hath been baptized into ſuch a <hi>faith,</hi> or rather into ſuch a <hi>formality;</hi> brought up
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169783:78"/> under ſuch Parents, lived under ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and accounted of the Pariſh-Church a member, then they think as well as the beſt. This is moſt mens ſecurity; and this is Satans ſubtilty to deceive the hearts of men. The Devil hath wrought a notable and cunning deſign in the world; to make people believe, that if they be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians, and in common, in ſuch a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that all is well, and that they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed, and members of the Church as well as the beſt. But let us not deceive our ſelves nor our ſouls, in being ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <hi>Jacks</hi> in Religion and Gods ſervice and worſhip; for <hi>all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael.</hi> And ſurely they muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, that hold forth the Church of Chriſt to Nations and Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the third Generall, <hi>That moſt mens faith is no better then the faith of Devils.</hi> The laſt follows, which is, <hi>That many mens obedience is not ſo good as the Devils is;</hi> for he believes and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>

                  <p>Stating the other branch of the Doctrine, with ſome cautions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat the Devils do believe, the Text is plain; and that moſt mens faith is no better, I have explained unto you. That which I am now to open, and you to own as truth, is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That many mens obedience is not ſo good; the Devils believe and tremble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take many men as they are under the power and command of God, and draw but forth their converſation and practice; and do but compare the imployment, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and obedience of the Devil, as he is under power and ſoveraignty, and it will be found, that many men fall ſhort of what the devil doth; for he doth believe Gods ſoveraignty and power, and tremble at it.</p>
               <p>Before I give you demonſtration, note the terms in the Theſis, or Doctrine by way of caution.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The terms that I put the propoſition into, is not all, but many; not believers, but wicked men; and amongſt wicked men,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169783:79"/> not all of all ſorts, but ſuch that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible: And how far ſhort or over, moral, and profane, and common profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors go, we ſhall anon examine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are to underſtand, that when I ſay it is not ſo good, I do not mean, that the devil hath any good obedience, or wicked men, properly ſo called, not any good <hi>via eminentiae, ſed via comparativa,</hi> by way of eminency, but by way of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their practice to Gods ſuperlative commands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By way of caution, know that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience both of wicked men, and of the devils too, is not obedience to anſwer, but to avoid: not any obedience as willing or chearful, but ſlaviſh and fearful. The <hi>Gaderenes</hi> and the Devils agree in this, in that paſſage, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 12, 17. they both would avoid, and could not endure to be moleſted; onely this is the difference, the devils beſought they might depart from Chriſt; the <hi>Gaderenes</hi> they deſire Chriſt would depart from them.</p>
               <p>That men and Devils are within the verge of Gods power &amp; precepts, it will appear, if we but compare <hi>Jobs</hi> firſt and ſecond Chapters; from whence we may clearly collect, that the Devil permiſſively may
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169783:80"/> tempt and ſtrip not onely the wicked, but even Gods own children. But yet obſerve, he is like a ſlave ſubmiſſive; though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing more then the ruine of Gods Church and people, yet he creeps at Gods commands, and keeps within the verge of Gods power and greatneſs. Indeed he ſeeks to devour all, and malice is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work; but if the Lord ſpeaks to the proud waves, <hi>Thus far may you ſwell, but no further:</hi> the Devil may touch <hi>Jobs</hi> goods, his cattel, and his children; but his life he muſt not; and he keeps touch, not out of any deſire the devil hath to preſerve one, or any wicked perſon; but would devour all, and ruine all: And therefore wonder wicked men at Gods goodneſs in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and your friends cruelty in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ruine and deſtruction; for the devil is our adverſary, though wicked mens ſuppoſed friend; <hi>and he goeth about continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally like a roaring lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Who would then be a ſlave to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? to whom though we are ſo willing to obey; yet if God did not reſtrain him, he would deſtroy us; and this is all the comfort a wicked man can have in all his ſweets of ſin; that though he pleaſe the devil, and pleaſe himſelf, but diſpleaſe God;

               <p n="1">1. FOr the explanation of the Doctrine, <hi>That many mens obedience is not ſo good as the Devils is.</hi> I ſhall compare the way and practice of man, with the way and practice of the devils: And let us in the hearing of it, or the reading, bring forth conſcience to judge the difference; for to that I ſhall now and then appeal unto, to clear the point in hand.</p>
               <p>Before the judgement ſeat of God all men appear in two ſorts, either ſheep or goats; godly or ungodly; good or bad; and the reaſon is, becauſe God judgeth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169783:81"/> like himſelf abſolute judgement; and we then ſhall ſay, <hi>That God is righteous in all his ways, and juſt in all his judgements:</hi> but now amongſt our ſelves, as we are in this world, and in our preſent being and practice, we may judge three ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yea, amongſt them that do profeſs for Chriſt, you have ſuch mixtures and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminglings, as ſpecial believers, general profeſſors, and commonly prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which are in a ſort profeſſors alſo: As the Apoſtle reduces all ſins into that Triplicite, <hi>The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> 1 John 2. 16. ſo every man and woman may be brought into one or other of thoſe three conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I dare not compare you amongſt your ſelves by name; but according to your ſeveral obedience, I ſhall compare it both for quantity and quality, and wager it to the text in hand, and the inſtance therein mentioned, which is the devil; for though it be ſaid, that all the forementioned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of men do believe; ſo doth the devil, and that with trembling: <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil believes and trembles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe you ſhould not think I would be partial, I ſhall inſtance in the firſt ſort that I mentioned; and do you that are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169783:82"/> either partial or impartial, judge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall call forth the obedience of true believers. Believers what ſay you, you have true faith, but imperfect obedience: And you ſee from the Text, that the Devils do believe; and alſo that they have ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Now dare you wager? Yes, may the holy ſoul ſay, Satan, all thy obedience it is but ſlaviſh; and therefore trembling Satan may be ſent by God, but he ſeeks all for himſelf: I live [may the true believer ſay] in the perfect law of liberty; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in all his ſubmiſſion and obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that command that genders unto bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Satan obeys indeed when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but all his obedience is in a curſe whoſe beginning and ending is in damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Satan moves under the power of wrath; but a believer moves becauſe he is moved; he loves becauſe he is firſt loved; and obeys through an infinite obedience, even the ſubmiſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Gal</hi> 2, 20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> Chriſt moves the Chriſtian to know, to work, to walk; he is the beginning and the progreſs, and the perfection of every true believers obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Every Chriſtian hath an infinite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becauſe Chriſt is his; and therefore he can triumphantly challenge all; as <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:169783:82"/> doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth; none can condemn; it is Chriſt that dyed, and is at Gods right hand for us, both to excuſe us, and acquit us, by his own infinite Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the Devil and wicked men may yield ſome obedience as God is a Lord and Soveraign; yet all that either of them can have, hath no acceptation, becauſe all they do or profeſs, it is but of ſervile and ſlaviſh fear.</p>
               <p>But now Chriſt hath brought believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a near relation; God being their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and himſelf being their Righteouſneſs, and the holy Spirit their Comforter, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them the obedience of Chriſt, which acteth them in power, and ſpirit, and life.</p>
               <p>And now wicked men you being Judges, which is beſt? the obedience of Chriſt, which is the obedience of Saints; for when Chriſt was obedient unto death, ſo were all the Saints: So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Reckon your ſelves dead, when Chriſt dyed; your ſelves riſen, when Chriſt was raiſed:</hi> And ſo of all his other ſaving benefits; they are all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted believers: and then judge you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of quantity, or in regard of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169783:83"/> quality. Every believers obedience is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as Chriſt is ſpiritual; and filial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was the onely Son; and with him, and through him, all are welcome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt preſents them unto his Father as Sons and Daughters, without ſpot or wrinkle.</p>
               <p>And then as for quality, ſo for quantity. As believers have ſpiritual fear, and love, and obedience; ſo likewiſe they have infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love and obedience: Chriſt being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in obedience; ſo is every believer by Chriſt Jeſus; <hi>For he is our Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Church; <hi>and my Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the ſoul: Not onely a <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of his Church, but as full and compleat for <note place="margin">Col. 2. 10.</note> every believer; ye are compleat in him who is not onely the head of his body the Church, but every member is in him; and Chriſt is infinite, and all in all: ſo that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Solomon. Prov.</hi> 12. 26. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is more excellent then his neighbor:</hi> True believers have <hi>Chriſt in them the hope of glory:</hi> And Chriſt for them all perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>

                  </label> although they have many, yea, it may be, groſs failings; as <hi>Noah, Lot,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had; yet judge the ſcope and end of their practice, by conſidering whats thy own, and what the Devils have. May be thou canſt ſay, Thou art not guilty of common and baſe enormities, ſuch as Drunkenneſs, Adultery, Swearing &amp;c, but tel me upon what ground doſt thou refrain? is it becauſe thou wouldſt not grieve the holy ſpirit of God? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. or is it becauſe thou knoweſt the curſe? upon this laſt account the Devil and all wicked men obey; not becauſe they bear any good will, love or liking to God or his ways, but out of hatred, envy, and ſlaviſh fear.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is ſaid to have converſe with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and what is it for <hi>but to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this end was Chriſts coming, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, dying, preaching, praying and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: And Believers in their meaſure tread in the ſame ſteps <hi>of exhorting and building up one another, even as Chriſt hath given them example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now take the Devil and all his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169783:84"/> Emiſſaries; and though they ſeek diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is it for but onely to devour and deſtroy? <hi>Your adverſary the devil goes about continually ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi> the Devil is continually in motion, very vigilant and active; but to what end? onely to ruine and confound ſuch whom God meaneth and mindeth to ſave. The Devil is very ready to run on Gods er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, as in that caſe of <hi>Job:</hi> but he endeavors altogether his own end, to murther and devour ſouls, and to deceive the hearts of the ſimple: He may be obedient to Gods Soveraignty; but think of his end, and give the verdict to thy own ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though a believers obedience is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Satans, becauſe the obedience of Chriſt is theirs; and what they do, they do from a principle of love, and not of hatred; but what is the obedience of common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>ſuch that have a name to live, but are dead;</hi> have outward ſeeming, but no inward ſanctity; <hi>having a form of godlineſs, but not matter and ſubſtance, true ſpirit and life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The higheſt of this ſort of mens obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may be accounted either in morality, or hypocriſie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For your morality, in that you are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169783:84"/> common profeſſors, and within the pale of the national Church; and none can ſay you are Drunkards, Swearers, or Blaſphemers, but a civil honeſt man, paying every man his own, relieving the poor, according to your proportion, I do no body no hurt, as God forbid I ſhould.</p>
               <p>But tell me, what good doeſt thou do? <hi>He that is not with me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is againſt me; and he that gathereth not, ſcattereth,</hi> Mat. 12. 30. What if one ſhould give his body to be burned? as it is poſſible, from the authority of that Apoſtle in that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. yet if this ſhould be, and the heart not linked in love to Chriſt; all ſuch performances would be like the untimely fruit of a woman, having no account before the Son of Righteouſneſs: For what will this amount to more, then what the Devil is ſaid to do? <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. The Phariſees did many glorious performances, had a zeal for God, much in alms, frequent in faſtings, paid every man his own, lived a moral life; ſo that none outwardly might ſay, <hi>Black was their eye;</hi> and yet Chriſt tells them plainly, <hi>They were of their father the devil, and his works they did;</hi> they had not ſtept one ſtep further then Satan, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their performances, becauſe they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169783:85"/> wanted ſingle and ſincere love to Chriſt: And that which is remarkable, our Saviour tells them, that though they did not do ſo plainly the Devils drudgery; yet they did dig in his Mines, row'd in his Galleys, wrought at his work; <hi>His works ye will do:</hi> As the Devil is moſt a Devil, when he ſeems to be an Angel of light: So all ſeeming profeſſion, without ſincere love to Chriſt, is from the Devil, and for the Devil; <hi>Ye are of him, his works ye do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As morality, ſo hypocriſie, that which accompanies common profeſſors in all their performances; And what is this more then what the Devils have? Take your common profeſſors; and what is their temper in all that they pretend for God, but like the <hi>Laodicean,</hi> of a lurkwarm temper, neither hot nor cold: And the Spirit of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims <note place="margin">Rev. 3.</note> ſuch not worth a caſting out, but to be ſpewed up; an expreſſion ſetting forth Gods loathing of hypocrites; as if he ſhould ſay, I abhor ſuch from my heart; and will, if men continue with deceitful tongues, and double hearts, throw them out with a vengeance: Take heed therefore thou holdeſt not a lye in thy right hand, ſeem to be for God, his Glory, Goſpel, Church and People, and yet underhand
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169783:85"/> work for Satan, and the deſtruction of all the truths and Saints of God, by thy ſecret, wicked and treacherous dealing. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil makes as large a profeſſion as the beſt of hypocrites; he profeſſes, yea, in a ſort prays too; as <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 12. the devil beſeeches Chriſt to depart; and without queſtion out of ſlaviſh fear was in earneſt: And herein the Devil ſurpaſſes many an hypocrite, for the Devils believe their damnation certain; and the hypocrite as a hypocrite is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but will not believe it. The difference between the Devil and an hypocrite is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, the devil obeys directly againſt the minde of God; but an hypocrite indirectly againſt the mercy and grace of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord: The Devil is a known hater, though a great pretender; but an hypocrite is a ſecret hater, and a great pretender: <hi>The Devil is known to be a roaring lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> but an hypocrite is known to be as a Saint, but inwardly a ravening woolf; a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prophet in ſheeps cloathing, but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ravening wolves: And coupling theſe together, judge you the difference.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let me now compare in the laſt place, ſuch that are commonly prophane; for though the ſcales were even before, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169783:86"/> the belief of common profeſſors, with the belief of Devils, and that the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of either did but anſwer the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of either, morality and hypocriſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weight of moſt mens Religion; yet there is a ſort, whoſe obedience is worſe then the Devils is, and that is ſuch men, who though they do profeſs, yet are openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and incorrigibly wicked; ſuch that are reſolved ſinners, that remain ſtubborn and obdurate under all judgements and mercies, ſuch a perſon that turns the grace of God into wantonneſs, and commits all kinde of ſin with greedineſs: Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as theſe are not ſo bad, but worſe then the Devils are; that practice in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in ſuch a manner, as if they would double damn themſelves; as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>ſuch that bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves ſwift deſtruction, that pull ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as with cart ropes, helping forward their own damnation:</hi> Such obdurate perſons are not ſo obedient as the Devils, but are more diſobedient: And that this may appear, mark what the text ſpeaks, <hi>The Devils tremble;</hi> but many men are more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they fear not ſin, judgement or wrath, but are inſolent and incorrigible under all.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:169783:86"/>
               <p> Although the text for this is very clear, yet for further teſtimony compare that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 43. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 15. betwixt theſe two Scriptures you may make this collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That there are ſome that are made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh by the ſophiſtry of hypocrites; and ſome that make themſelves more deviliſh, by ſweeping and garniſhing, attiring and priding themſelves for Satan, make prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Satan; and both are ſaid to be children of Satan, but by their own incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibleneſs and deviliſh hypocriſie far worſe. Man is ſo wicked, that he doth more then the Devil doth; for he makes his own eſtate worſe then it was; And though the Devils inſtruments are deviliſh, yet others may be ſaid <hi>to be made by them twofold more the children of hell then they themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God ſpeaks out thunderings, the Devil couches, he trembles: But how often hath many a wicked man been call'd unto from heaven, and commanded to come out of the gall of bitterneſs, and the bonds of iniquity; but inſtead of unlooſing, he chains himſelf more faſter, and waxes worſe and worſe, hating to be reformed, but making himſelf more and more deformed, by all impiety and wilful wickedneſs. If the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169783:87"/> Lord ſpeak to Satan to tempt <hi>Job,</hi> as by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans deſire he did permit, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6. and 2. 2, 3, 4, 5. and yet obſerve, notwithſtanding the devil had permiſſion, he keeps within his commiſſion and ſubmiſſion; he hath liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to touch all but his life; but wicked man as much as in him lies, kills life, and love, and all.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt ſay to the unclean ſpirits, <hi>Come forth,</hi> they preſently obey; as in that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 31. <hi>They beſought him:</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils obey and pray; But how many wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are there that will do neither? but curſe, and ſwear, and forſwear; ſo that many do outdo the Devil in wickedneſs, but come ſhort of him in obedience.</p>
               <p>How often hath the Drunkard, Swearer, Proud and Licentious perſons heard the call and command of God by his word and works of judgement and mercies? but when ſhall we finde them trembling, as the Devil doth, but rather worſe and worſe, like the dog they ſtill turn to the vomit: The drunkard hears the word, but acts in drunkenneſs; the covetous wretch ſtill wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in his covetouſneſs, notwithſtanding the often call of the Word, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>our converſations ſhould be in heaven, and in earth without covetouſneſs.</hi> Judge
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169783:87"/> you that have but ſenſe and reaſon, Who is moſt obedient? He that trembles at Gods power and greatneſs; Or he that hears Gods word of truth and mercy, but obeys not?</p>
               <p>How often have wicked men heard Gods command, ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walk in it;</hi> and, <hi>Obſerve that which I command you?</hi> But how often haſt thou rebelled and caſt <note place="margin">Deut. 47. 11.</note> all behind thy back? How often have the wicked heard Gods judgment rendred with threatning and vengeance? But when didſt thou tremble? How often have you heard the call of Mercy, and the Grace of the Chriſt of Love? but when did thy heart melt, and thy eyes ſhed tears in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an offended Majeſty, and a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saviour, whom your wicked hands and hearts have crucified and ſlain? Of a truth thou art worſe, more obdurate then Satan; for one of theſe makes the Devil tremble; he trembles at Gods greatneſs: but thou art hardned under all. Soveraignty, and power, and wrath fears the Devil; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will make wicked men to fear, at leaſt to be filial. And judge you Righteous, what's the difference.</p>
               <p>And if any would know a reaſon why the Devil is more obedient then many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169783:88"/> creatures, it is nor wilt be ſo; for God commands the contrary: And what though, thou wilt ſay, the Devil tempts? know alſo, the Devil cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain; but mark the deſperate wickedneſs of thy own baſe and corrupt ſpirit; <hi>For this is the condemnation, that light is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, but men love darkneſs rather, or more then light, becauſe their deeds are evil,</hi> John 3. 19.</p>

               <p>THus having the demonſtration, take a word or two of Aggravation, and alſo of Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of Aggravation: Know, thou that art an incorrigible prophane perſon, thou art worſe then the Devils are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thou art under diſpenſation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Grace, and Mercy: Thou art taught by judgements, and by mercies, but cannot be wrought upon; thou haſt uſe of means,

               <p n="2">2. The Devil lives not under daily mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as wicked and prophane men do; God giving them fruitful ſeaſons, and feeding them with food and gladneſs; yet how doth the Devil own Gods call, and keep to his Commiſſion, and trembles at his word and power? but wicked men at nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Although the Devil be without hope, ſo that if he would repent, yet he cannot; yet the Devil goes when God commands, yea he dreads and trembles at Gods So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty: So long as there is life, we ſay there is hope; O be aſhamed, or ſhame the Devil, for he obeys that cannot repent; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thou and obey, leaſt thou be eternally hardened.</p>

Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt is that which thou liveſt under in theſe days of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is tydings of gladneſs; and by the Apoſtle called great ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſuch great ſalvation?</hi> that is, more then the Miniſtry of Angels, even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf in his own diſpenſations is offered and tendred. And if ſalvation be ſo great, and the tender of it ſo large, as to the worſt of ſinners, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169783:89"/> upon thee, but rejecting the Devil, yet the Devil more yielding; this muſt needs be a great aggravation; for the Devil trembles under the ſence of power and wrath; thou as an unbeliever art obdurate under the tender of grace and love; and therefore thou wilt he unexcuſable, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, that living under the means of grace, neglecting the means; thou wilt be found a rejecter of mercy; And how wilt thou eſcape? thou bringeſt upon thy ſelf ſwift deſtruction, which the devil would not do.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There is this aggravation in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unbelievers miſery, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil be firſt in torment, yet wicked and incorrigible perſons will be moſt in torment; for though the Devil be a Prince of darkneſs, yet is he a miſerable ſlave; yet if thou live and dye in unbelief, thou wilt be a ſlave unto this ſlave; yea, all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils will tyrannize over thee: And know, to thy fear and trembling, there is the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of mercy and providence will burn thee in hell, which will not ſcorch the Devil. The Devil ſhall have the fire of wrath, but the aggravation of mercy will be all cruelties on ſuch that obey not the Goſpel; the mercy of God will be in wrath
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169783:90"/> and judgement, all will be to wicked men a conſuming fire; therefore fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conſider, if mercy will not melt you, wrath and fury will pierce you, and conſume you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As a word of uſe: What terror is this to ſuch that are implacably wicked! Oh the fears and torments that will ſhortly be on ſuch that are wanton and negligent under mercy, now the day of vengeance is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching! and think never ſo ſlightly, there is no eſcaping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Uſe by way of reſtraint: Will all be againſt wicked men at laſt? What a miſery is it that love and mercy will not conſtrain you? Now my delight is not in this to inlarge; but would the love of God in Chriſt might conſtrain you; if not, let the fear of wrath reſtrain you, or elſe for certain the Devil will take you: And who would be a childe to ſuch a father, a ſlave to ſuch a ſlave? Do not let the Devil ſhame thee; but let the wrath of God fear thee, and his Love and Mercy melt thee.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, Saints heighten up your ſpirits and your expectation; though the wicked now laugh, and you mourn, yet when death comes, their bands begin;

               <p>The Text is an Argumentative petition of <hi>Davids,</hi> [not to move God] but that the Lord would move towards him in pity and compaſſion; as the beggar, when at the bountiful door, knows he is Lord of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the Maſter of the houſe is Lord of all; and therefore he tells his condition, I am hungry, cold, and comfortleſs, naked,

Chriſtians, conſider this in the midſt of your afflictions: What a mercy is it that you may go to God with them? I am ſad and penſive, husbandleſs, and comfortleſs; and this as a praying encouragement; as, <hi>The Lord to be thy joy, thy head and comforter,</hi> &amp;c.

               </argument>
               <p>I Shall unfold this Doctrine, firſt by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you how, and in what regard the Saints are Strangers in the earth, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ground why they are ſaid to be ſtrangers; and then make uſe of it to our preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How are the Saints ſaid to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in this earth? are they not livers, dwellers, and dealers in the earth as well as other of the children of men: They are ſo; but yet the Saints are ſtrangers in the earth; and that in theſe three reſpects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of their entertainment and <note place="margin">1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> acquaintance: I might make theſe diſtinct, but for brevities ſake in one, and at once. In theſe reſpects the children of God are ſtrangers in the world; as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo are the Saints now: And how was that? was it not with hard entertainment, with hard uſage? bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and bondage was their greateſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges: For Gods Iſrael to be under Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters ſo many years, was very ſtrange, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169783:94"/> yet very true, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7. And what more is now unto Gods children? the world is ſtill an <hi>Egypt</hi> unto them, it ſtills ſtrives to keep in bondage, it tempts and ſtricks, it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with burthens, and acquaints with <note place="margin">Mark. 5. 17.</note> woes. We know ſtrangers finde cold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, becauſe of non-acquaintance. The world is like the <hi>Gaderenes,</hi> ſtill cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Depart ye profeſſors, we deſire neither your company nor acquaintance: How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is it that the men of the world are not at home, though at home? but wiſhing this and that, becauſe a childe of God is in his houſe; he thinketh every minute ſeven till he hath done talking, and done com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying; and however his ſeemings may be, yet inwardly he ſays, Depart, I deſire not your company nor acquaintance; O that I were rid of this ſame fellow, not friend, though he be a neighbor or a Town-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, yet being a profeſſor, he will not be familiar: But now let this worldling have but one of its worldly brats come in; O what ſtroaking ſoothing, and ſuckering and ſhaking of hands, and brother, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and brother in iniquity; he hath all the welcome as at houſe and home; but to profeſſors, the world is not at home to them, nor they unto the world; like as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169783:95"/> ſtrangers, cold in acquaintance, and cold in entertainment: And the like meaſure from the world, and in the world findes Chriſt himſelf; he had but little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but fewer friends, but cold entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all: And as he is, ſo are the Saints in this world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 17. and let not Gods children look for better; but if we finde the like, let us take up <hi>Pauls</hi> reſolution; and ſay, and pray, and live, but not in the worlds crowns nor croſſes; but in the croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom or whereby <hi>the world is crucified unto us, and we unto the world,</hi> Gal. 6. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saints are ſtrangers on the earth, in <note place="margin">In regard of their deſires.</note> regard of their deſires: True it is, they are not in their perſons until their change comes; but in regard of their affections and ſpiritual deſires, before their change. Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1. 23. <hi>I deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Heaven is my home, and Chriſt is my habitation; yea, and however I am here in the body, yet I am but as a ſtranger, my affections and deſires are with the Lord; and that at preſent while we are in the body, we wait till our change comes: And what is our deſire in the mean while? <hi>David</hi> tells you the Saints and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169783:95"/> holy ſouls deſire in their preſent ſtate, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is nothing upon earth that I deſire beſides thee;</hi> yea, though fleſh and heart fail, yet my deſires faint not, but in the midſt of all my faintings and failings, the Lord is the ſtrength and ſupport of my ſoul, and my everlaſting portion.</p>
               <p>Ask a worldling, Where is your home, and your deſires at morning, noon, night? and they muſt tell you in the world, and worldly cares; our home and heart is where our treaſure is, laboring all day, and caſting at night for the things of this life: Our converſation is amongſt the creatures, this is our home, and our deſires are not to be removed.</p>
               <p>But now ask a Chriſtian, Where is your home? alas, ſay they, not in the body; though I am in the body, yet I am abſent <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 6.</note> from my home, my home is with the Lord; and my deſires are to be at home. Judge world as you will of the worth of the ſoul, and the eſteem of heaven, which is mine and my fathers manſion; yet methinks that is the place, my converſation is in heaven, and at preſent I cannot but deſire home. A ſtrangers will ſay, Home is home, though never ſo homely: So ſay Gods

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169783:97"/> when they come to a friends houſe, though they partake of a friends morſels, and that with welcom, with freeneſs, and fulneſs; yet they wil tel you, though it be all good, tis not ſo kindly.

               <p>So it is with Chriſtians, while in this world: they may have all things with welcom from the Lord, while in this world, and ofttimes they have many kindneſſes; the Lord ſpreads a Chriſtians table in the midſt of adverſaries, giving a poor ſoul much comfort, ſolace, and contentment; yet ſaith the ſoul, Notwithſtanding all theſe kindneſſes I receive in this world, and that with the Lords welcom, yet all is not ſo kindly as if I were at home: Oh my Fathers promiſe and providence, it is ſweet; but at his houſe, and from his hand, and at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is the kindneſs that is moſt kindly. Bread is ſweet, and life's a comfort; but the God of all comfort is beſt of all: And I count not any thing dear, that I may go home, though all be mine, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24.</p>

                  <hi>Lord.</hi> A Chriſtians abode is not altogether in the body, while in the body; but however ſtill their deſires are working upward, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Our converſation at preſent is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from whence alſo we look for the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Where our kinsfolks and our ftiends are, we do not count ſtrange: but when one is without father or friend, and in a ſtrange place too, this muſt needs be ſtrange. And Chriſtians are thus deſtitute as from the world. Thus are the Saints fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and friendleſs, as I may ſo expreſs it: the world will afford them hatred; and it is no other meaſure then the true Friend of Saints met with, even our Lord Jeſus: and he bids his Diſciples not to wonder at the worlds uſage; why? becauſe they are <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29. <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> not of the worlds linage, not of that ſtock or race. Saints, you came of another kind, of another generation; ye are a <hi>choſen generation,</hi> of a more noble family: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are eſteemed as ſtrangers on the earth; it is becauſe your kindred is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:169783:98"/> 
                  <hi>of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Mark; the world hath a double enmity <note place="margin">Saints have a double enmity from the world.</note> againſt the Saints: Firſt, they envy, becauſe they are in the world, and not of the world; If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; therefore are ye hated. And ſecondly, they envy becauſe the Saints are choſen out; for that they are Chriſts friends, therefore are they hated. Chriſtians are to make the words of Chriſt good, as well as the world makes them, as the Saints find by the worlds daily enmity. Saith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>And if I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me.</hi> This he did virtually on the Croſs, and in his reſurrection and aſcenſion, as a publike perſon for all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And the faith of Chriſtians is to act much this way. Saith the Apoſtle to the Romans, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Chriſt was lifted up in the ſtead of all Believers; and Believers are to make their reckoning ſo, that when he died they died; Redemption, ſatisfaction, and juſtification was all by Chriſt, and with Chriſt, as in the perſon of all Believers; they were all lifted up with him. So that that of the Apoſtle may be triumphed in by all
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169783:99"/> Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34, &amp;c. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> He juſtifieth Chriſt, as being lifted up for all Believers; as on the Croſs, as from the grave, as aſcending into heaven, as ſitting at the right hand of God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for us.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, the principle of all motion upward or heaven-ward, it is all in Chriſt; <note place="margin">Jo. 15. 5.</note> without him we can do nothing: He it is that is the Spring and Principle of all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly heart motion. <hi>And if I be lifted up, &amp;c.</hi> Not an <hi>[if]</hi> of doubting, but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. And therefore to bring it home, Chriſt doth draw up the hearts of all Gods children to have company with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with their Brother the Lord Jeſus; <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 11.</note> for he is not aſhamed to call them ſo. Saints muſt needs be ſtrangers on the earth, when their company, kindred and acquaintance are in heaven. And thus ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you.</hi> And what was that? That was the manifeſtation and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Lord Jeſus in the fleſh, as upon the earth, as appears in the former verſes. Well, but to what end was this? To take them off from falſe fellowſhip, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them into the true: for ſaith <hi>John,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:169783:99"/> 
                  <hi>That ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us;</hi> implying, that though they were in the world, yet they were ſtrangers. And if you be Saints, ſo muſt you be too. We have but ſmall acquaintance here below: we are indeed on the earth, but truly we are ſtrangers, we have little acquaintance or accord with the world, but as paſſengers we muſt take our lodging for a night; and that night here, though we be brethren, we are ready to fall out by the way; but however we have a Father and a fellowſhip, though here but little friendſhip; yet above, not on earth, but in the heavens, we have there both kindred and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; there's our Father, and there's our friend, and there's our fellowſhip; <hi>For truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and his Son Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Saints are ſtrangers in the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the world is ſtrange to them. The Saints have large hearts for the Good of the world, but not for the Goods of the world. My hearts deſire, ſaith a true Child of God, is, That none might periſh, but <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 7. Ro. 10. 1.</note> that all might come unto the knowledge and obedience of the truth. But they will not; The world will be ſtrange to Chriſt, and ſtrange to Chriſtians; and we muſt be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169783:100"/> ſtrange to them, or elſe be ſtrangers unto the Lord, and unto his truths. For what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters; for either he will hate the one, or love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could wiſh all Moral hearts would conſider this, and not couzen the ſoul by their double haltings. But now the Saint takes the word of Chriſt for truth; and ſaith, Rather then I will be a ſtranger unto Chriſt, I will be ſtrange unto the world; For <hi>(Iam.</hi> 4. 4.) <hi>The friendſhip of the world is enmity againſt Chriſt.</hi> What though we have frowns from the world, and the world will be ſtrange to us? yet we have favours from our friend: Yea, though in the world we have a portion of perſecution, yet from Chriſt we have a portion of comfort. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> ſtrangeneſs, and hard uſage; <hi>but be of good comfort, I have overcome the world.</hi> And this is a precious favour, Believers, (believe it) againſt the worlds frowns.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Saints are ſtrangers in this earth, becauſe there is a neceſſity of either being ſtrangers, or friends. The Texts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 24.</note> ſpeak a neceſſity of being one, <hi>Ye</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:169783:100"/> 
                  <hi>cannot ſerve God and Mammon;</hi> be in friendſhip with the world, and in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Lord: We muſt either hate the one, or love the other; hold to the one, or deſpiſe the other. And ſaith the godly heart, Rather then I will be eſtranged from the Lord, take the worlds friendſhip who will; I will not have it at ſuch a rate as to loſe my friendſhip with the Lord, <hi>For in his favour is life,</hi> Pſ. 30. 5. What though I am a ſtranger and a traveller for a night? I ſhall be at home in the morning; when I awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs. <note place="margin">Pſ. 17. 15.</note> And therefore what though a ſtranger here? there is a neceſſity, except I would loſe the Lords favour; but that is better then life. Away therefore world, away riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, profits! Rather then to loſe the ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Sun, the Moon ſhall be under my feet: Rather then be eſtranged from my precious Father, and my friend the Lord Jeſus, all the worlds pomp, glory and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, all ſublunary things ſhall be under my feet.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the Saints are ſtrangers in the earth: Firſt, becauſe they are not at home; ſecondly, becauſe their acquaintance and kindred are in heaven; thirdly, becauſe the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169783:101"/> world is ſtrange to them. And Fourthly, becauſe of neceſſity they muſt be ſtrangers or friends.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Have you another place in your eye, then this your preſent enjoyment? ſtrangers ſtill think of home; ſo Saints are ſtill thinking of their eternity, the home of heaven is ſtill in the eye of faith, and heart of love of every true believer.

               <p>The fourth and laſt Character is this; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether the world loves you, or if it hates you: The lovers of the world, and the beloved of the world, are not the children of God, but the children of the world: Chriſt gives this as a Chriſtians character, <hi>John</hi> 15. 18, 19. <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me, before it hated you: If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the world, therefore the world hates you:</hi> Mark it, <hi>If ye were of the world;</hi> that is, if you were one of them, and in their family, having one father, you would have the ſame friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the world would love his own, not count you ſtrangers, but ſtroke you as one of her own worldly brats: But if you are of heavens family, &amp; are travellers through the world, as through a wilderneſs, to your <hi>Canaan</hi> and reſt, as the traveller through a Town, the dogs will bark; ſo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans through this world, muſt expect the <hi>Amalekites</hi> at their heels, biting and baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, ſcorning and reproaching againſt

               <p n="1">1. In the Negative; be dehorted not to imbrace this preſent world; and that in three reſpects. Firſt, in regard of the evil of it. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>All that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> Here's luſt, and luſt, and fleſh, and filth; evil in all, and all in evil. <hi>The whole world lyeth in wickedneſs,</hi> or in <note place="margin">1 John 5. 19.</note> that <hi>wicked one,</hi> which next unto the Devil is the corrupt Heart of man, ſaith the Preacher in his book of the Creatures, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 11. He hath ſet the world in their hearts. Mans heart contains a world; the <hi>Microcoſmus</hi> in the <hi>Coſmus:</hi> The little world <hi>Man,</hi> in the great world <hi>Nature,</hi> hath a world of evil, and a world of pride. Oh but for the Evil ſake, Chriſtians, be eſtranged, and do not imbrace this preſent world; it is a world of evil: It is too too much it is in our hearts; but it is too too woful, if our hearts be in that. Secondly, in regard of the danger of it; danger of this, and danger of that: but remark the danger, as <hi>Ioh</hi> 1. 2. 15. <hi>The Father, the love of the Father is not in you.</hi> Whats that? why, eſtrangement from the Lord. <hi>Demas hath forſaken us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. He ſpeaks it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169783:104"/> bewailingly, as ſenſible of the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in embracing the preſent world: He was a ſtranger to the Faith, a ſtranger to the Church, a ſtaggering to the Saints, and to be feared, a ſtranger to the Lord. And this danger comes by being an imbracer of the world. O Profeſſors, Profeſſors, look to your footing, and take heed of faltering; take heed of being <hi>Demas,</hi> in forſaking the Lord, and claſping of the world; forſaking the fountain and the ſtream, <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and cloſing with broken ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, this worlds <hi>Cruel courteſies,</hi> that are <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 13.</note> no ſooner <hi>in</hi> but <hi>out;</hi> they are broken ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns that can hold no water. Hang about the worlds neck, and kiſs it and imbrace it never ſo much, yet it will prove a <hi>Iudas</hi> to thee; it will kiſs thee again, but it will kill thee at laſt. And then thus forſaking Chriſt, who can ſave thee?</p>
               <p>Were it not a madneſs for a poor Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, after he is lancht out into the deep, that he upon ſome wandering thoughts ſhould then go out of the ſhip into the midſt of the Sea, to go unto the ſhore? might not all the Mariners think there was little hope of his life? Truly the danger is greater unto every poor ſoul that is in the Church by profeſſion, and yet had rather,

The Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have meat in heart and hand, I mean at preſent, that the world knows not of; but alas Saints, though this be wine and milk, yet this is but the firſt meſs in this ſpiritual banquet.

Comfort your ſelves Chriſtians in the fears of ſuch a death as may and will come on you; Conſider whatſoever others have, yet a believer hath no cauſe to grieve, or to be afraid of death; for though a man or woman out of Chriſt, dying, dyes again; a firſt and ſecond death hath power over every unbeliever, and ſo cauſe of them of fears; but now a childe of God cannot be properly ſaid to dye; death to a godly man or woman, is but <hi>Aliquid Mortis;</hi> ſomething of death, but a <hi>tranſit;</hi> but an <hi>Exodus,</hi> a going out, as <hi>Moſes</hi> to go up unto <note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and dye; ſo death to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart is but a going to their reſt; as a man that puts off his clothes, goeth to bed for reſt and eaſe, until the morning: even ſo the Saints put off their clothes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances of this life, lying down in the grave until the reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What cauſe of comfort, rather then for grieving in the departure of friends by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169783:113"/> death; if they dye as Chriſtians, they dye in the Lord, and then there is annexed a bleſſedneſs to ſuch, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, they reſt from their labors:</hi> Who would not take comfort in reading ſuch Scripture expeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? but much more as lively occaſions in the death of Saints, This is the time for Chriſtians not onely to be reading, but rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over Scripture promiſes; for many through death have their greater income, as life everlaſting: And why ſhould the death of any Chriſtian friends to us ſeem grievous, when in the ſight of the Lord they are precious? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 15. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi> Chriſt is precious unto believers <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 6.</note> in life, and this is a great comfort; but that believers ſhould be precious unto Chriſt in his death, is not that as great a comfort? why then Chriſtians, be not ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but revived, not as ſorrowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, but joying in your hope, and longing for the ſame fellowſhip; <hi>For ſo long as we are in the body, we are abſent from the Lord; but being abſent from the body, we are preſent with the Lord.</hi> We crop the flowers; but what for? not to fling away, but to put into our boſoms:

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169783:115"/> down at this worlds changes, I thought it ſeaſonable to pick out a Leſſon or two from theſe words; that ſo God would pleaſe to let us have more ſtable hearts in theſe unſtable times, and not be toſt too and fro by every wind of worldly diſtreſs or ſucceſs; he that rejoyceth, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God, and not in mans tranſactions in this worlds changes; for all ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is vain.</p>
            <p>I ſhall as briefly as I can, give you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of expoſition, and then touch upon ſome obſervations from the words: But firſt take notice that the Epitome of this Book, is to ſhew the vanity of all creatures, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity;</hi> more either in name, or for nature, cannot well be expreſſed; not any part free, but it is all; and that not as of a ſimple nature onely, but alſo as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>It is vanity of vanities.</hi> And that <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 15. &amp; 7. 13.</note> which I rather mention it for, is, he doth it much upon a rational account, ſaying in every other verſe, <hi>I conſidered, I conſidered;</hi> and withal keeping ſtill to the object of mans reaſon, <hi>All things under the Sun,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 3, 7. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. 12. And certainly if I would be a great admirer of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or the will of man, which is the top of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169783:115"/> it, I know no book more amongſt all the books of truth that ſpeaks for it or to it then this of <hi>Solomons;</hi> he puts every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence [as it were] upon a rational account, ſaying, <hi>I conſidered, I conſidered times and things, and I finde them thus and thus, and ſo do you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But now obſerve, and all you that are ſo much for mans reaſon, and will, take notice of it, that though he calls to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of times and things, yet he centers not any thing in the creature, but determines all in God, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>I ſaid in my heart, God ſhall judge the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſaid in mine heart concerning the eſtate of the Sons of men, that God might manifeſt them, and that they may ſee that they themſelves are beaſts.</hi> So likewiſe in the 5. Chapter, Ver. 19. <hi>Reaſon nor induſtry getteth not riches, but theſe are gifts as from the hand of God:</hi> not on mans improvement: No, mark how he ſilences mans reaſon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Say not thou, what is the cauſe that the former days are better then theſe? for thou doeſt not enquire wiſely concerning this:</hi> So <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. <hi>Conſider the work of God: for who can make that ſtrait which he hath made crooked?</hi> and alſo in the Text, God hath ſet <hi>proſperity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>adverſity, that man ſhould not finde</hi>

But I come to the Text, <hi>In the day of proſperity rejoyce, but in the day of adverſity conſider, God hath ſet the one over,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The whole verſe contains two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. What man doth upon this worlds <note place="margin">di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of text.</note> changes: <hi>In the day of proſperity, he rejoyces,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What the Lord doth in or upon this doing of man. Man would be judging
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169783:116"/> abſolutely the things and actings of God by outward appearances of proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; but mark, God ſets one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to ſilence mans cenſuring.</p>
            <p>For explication, let us conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we do upon this worlds changes <hi>In the day of proſperity we rejoyce, and in the day of adverſity, &amp;c.</hi> I conceive we are not ſo to underſtand it as of a thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if the Lord commanded us to rejoyce in our proſperity; but as our uſual practice is, we do do ſo: as reaſons rule and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for to be joyful if ſuccesful. A parallel Scripture to this you have <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Rejoyce, O yong man, in thy youth, and let thine heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee unto judgement:</hi> Not that any young men from the authority of this Text are commanded to walk in the ways of their own hearts, or in the delights of their own eyes; but it ſhews what youth would do: So here rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons rule is, to be joyful, if proſperous: and grieved, if diſtreſſed; it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to our practice; it is our inclination, and ſuits our reaſon ſo to do; and therefore obſerve, had it been in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169783:117"/> day of proſperity mourn, be penſive, and lament; and in the day of diſtreſs rejoyce, and be glad; this had been reaſons Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; but it is as the courſe and cuſtom of the world doth; in the day of proſperity, they rejoyce, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here are two days, but much different in light and occaſions, a day of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a day adverſity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by <hi>Day;</hi> and this we are to underſtand a time or ſeaſon; not a day Artificial, or a day Natural, but a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he ſpeaks in that of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under the Sun; A time to be born, a time to dye; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted:</hi> So here in the day, that is, in the ſeaſon and time of proſperity.</p>
            <p>So our Saviour in that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 34. <hi>Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof;</hi> that is, in every ſtate, time and condition in this life, there is a ſufficiency of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, temptation and incumbrances of evil that doth accompany that time or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So here, in the day, in that ſtate and condition. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the day of proſperity: The day of glory is a proſperous ſtate indeed for the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169783:117"/> ſoul to rejoyce in; but I take not this to be meant here: But rather a day of proſperity, as to a day that is reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this world; and this moſt genuine to the ſcope, as, <hi>All things under the Sun,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ; 1. 3. &amp; 3. 1.</note> and <hi>under heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that proſperity may be called a day, I ſhall inſtance but in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the day is light and chearful, ſo is proſperity; A heavy purſe makes a light heart, is our common Proverb; and let a man be but ſucceſsful, and there is no queſtion of his being joyful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>In my time of proſperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved:</hi> So many a poor heart having a day in this life, by being careleſs and ſecure, benights his ſoul to all eternity. Thus the rich man in the Goſpel, having a day of proſperity, he ſings requiems to his ſoul, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt a day, yea, goods laid up for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 12. 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>many years;</hi> but little thinks he of the night following, and the loſs of his ſoul: And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Therefore in the next place, proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is called a day in regard of the bounds and limits of it: Every day hath its bounds
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169783:118"/> and limits: So hath all this worlds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; every day hath its morning; ſo hath proſperity.</p>
            <p>As the babe grows by degrees to be a man; ſo the poor eſtate hath its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be proſperous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every day hath not onely its morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but its noon; ſo hath proſperity; as the Sun after he is riſen, mounteth to the <hi>Meridian;</hi> ſo man in his proſperity he hath a noon-tyde, wherein all his joy is elevated to the higheſt pitch; but doth it ſtay there? No, like the day, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity declines again. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every day hath its evening, and night alſo; ſo hath proſperity; the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt day, hath its period; and ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous purchaſer of all his Lands: Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards may rejoyce, and worldly huckſters ſing, and riches may encreaſe; but know thy day will have a night; and for all theſe things thou muſt come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: remember therefore in this thy day of proſperity, that every day hath its Sun. God made the greater light to <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 16.</note> rule the day; ſo let thy day of proſperity have a Sun; yea let the <hi>Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:169783:118"/> rule thy heart in thy proſperity; ſerve him whoſe bounty ſhines on thee to make thee proſperous; and ſo though thou mayeſt have an evening, yet no night of proſperity; for in ſerving the Sun, I mean thy Saviour, thou wilt be more and more proſperous: <hi>For the Lord God is a Sun and a Shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will he withhold from them that walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Pſal. 84. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now how is it that adverſity is called a day? ſurely conſidering the terms as extreams, adverſity ſhould be rather cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, He called proſperity a day <label type="milestone">

               </label> becauſe of joy, the wages and the fruit of it being lightſom; but now although adverſity may be rather a true night, yet in regard of the work of it, it is called a day; for that the creature is brought unto ſerious conſideration; which in proſperity is oft [if not always] remiſs, carnal, ſecure, and careleſs: In this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe cryeth the Prophet <hi>Agur, Pro.</hi> 30. 8, 9. <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</hi> Both extreams attended with vanity;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169783:119"/> and though he prays againſt poverty firſt, yet obſerve, he reaſons in regard of proſperity, the danger lying in that moſt; and therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Leaſt I be full and deny thee:</hi> the word imports a gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or belying the Lord: Adverſity though it brings fears, yet ſpiritually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as againſt our natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is better hopes in us, when we are wanting, then when abounding: <hi>It is better to go to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of laughter:</hi> why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one makes me to conſider, the other to forget and to be careleſs: Gods regard is to the <hi>wanting,</hi> and not to the <hi>Wanton, Luke</hi> 1. 53. <hi>He filleth the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with good things;</hi> But what doth he do with the full and wanton? <hi>He ſendeth them empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Jeſurun waxed fat,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Deu.</hi> 32. 15.

When <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was in proſperity, he ſaith, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey him?</hi> but

The ſum of which is this, It ſeems man acts and judges according to preſent events; if proſperous, he falls to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but if ruinous, he falls to be penſive, to pine and mourn; if things fall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he ſits down in ſorrow: But now what doth the Lord do upon this doing of man? he weigheth both theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtates in which man acteth and judgeth ſo contrary; and to him the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance is equal; they are both alike to him; that is, the Lord takes this <hi>worlds proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and he poiſes it againſt the <hi>worlds adverſity;</hi> or rather thus, he takes thee <hi>thou rich and proſperous man,</hi> &amp; poiſes thy proſperity, riches, and honors, and this worlds good; he takes alſo thee that art in <hi>poverty and abaſement,</hi> and haſt this worlds croſſes, and he poiſes that: Now man thinks a vaſt difference in each, judges the ſcale of proſperity to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly more weighty then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but now in the hands of God they are both alike, the ballance is equal, he ſets one againſt another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169783:120"/> requiems: every one will bid him good morrow that is rich and proſperous; but if in poverty and diſtreſs, then the world judges thou art forſaken; But to the Judge of heaven and earth you are alike: The judgement according unto truth, is of the Lord; but judgement in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and our eſtimation is as men: We judge a vaſt difference, diſtance and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem between <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Adverſity:</hi> But there is none, ſaith the Lord; as in my hands, the poor man is not forſaken, though laid low; nor that ſide bleſt that is raiſed up; they are both alike to God; <hi>for he ſetteth one over againſt another:</hi> And if we would know why God doth thus; the Text gives you a reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even to ſhew mans wiſdom to be but fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>He ſets one over againſt another, that man ſhould not finde any thing after him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man in the tranſactions of Nations or Perſons, would be judging and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to preſent events; but ſaith the Lord, this is not the way, <hi>Judge</hi>

            <p>Though man think proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity like two parallel lines that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meet, but run out <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> the Lord thwarts them, and makes them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogonical, both alike, meeting in him the center of all wiſdom and mercy, as with like eſteem, number, weight and meaſure.</p>
            <p>And that this might further be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, I ſhall give you in a word both a National and a Perſonal inſtance.</p>
            <p>The firſt inſtance is National, which is that of the Jewiſh State; they were in proſperity, in outward priviledges, and of which they boaſted, ſaying, <hi>The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 4.</note> 
               <hi>of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> yea, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>That unto them were committed the Oracles of God;</hi> they were the Lords people, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled from the world by circumciſion: But now what were the Gentiles, but as the wilde olive, as in a barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and outcaſts and ſtrangers? And
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169783:121"/> how hath God ſet proſperity againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, &amp; adverſity againſt proſperity, in turning theſe different ſtates? The high hath he broken off, the mean hath he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in; yea, and in the Jewiſh pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bring in riches to the Gentiles; their fall, our riſing; their return the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world; how the Lord hath ſet proſperity and adverſity one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theſe different States of Jews and Gentiles; and how the Lord hath done with us in our late tranſactions, for to bring to paſs this Engliſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, any indifferent heart may eaſily make out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perſonal inſtance, which alſo may be National, is, firſt that caſe of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as you have it, <hi>Gen:</hi> 25. 23. compared with <hi>Rom</hi> 9. 11, 12. Here were two perſons, which likewiſe were the heads of two Nations, both in one womb; here was proſperity and adverſity, in that one was choſen, the other rejected; <hi>Jacob have I loved, Eſau have I hated;</hi> and yet neither proſperity nor adverſity, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the perſons in themſelves, having done neither good nor evil: And yet to ſilence all mens reaſonings, here are Sons
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169783:122"/> of one Father, ſtriving in one womb, and heads of two mighty Nations; yet in theſe, proſperity is ſet againſt adverſity, that man ſhould not finde any thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</p>
            <p>Again, in the 15, 16, 17, 18. Verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Text, you may perceive this to be made good. Saith <hi>Solomon, All things have I ſeen in the days of my vanity: There is a juſt man that periſheth in his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and there is a wicked man prolongeth his life in his wickedneſs;</hi> then follows, <hi>Be not overmuch wicked;</hi> and <hi>Be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much righteous, neither make thy ſelf over wiſe; why ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf &amp;c.</hi> Here is one thing ſet over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; mans own righteouſneſs, as well as mans own wickedneſs may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
            <p>The Lord taketh the Self-righteous perſon, that is righteous in his own eyes; after he hath built himſelf up, he throws him down again, and lays him amongſt the moſt wicked, and then raiſes him up to glory and honor in Chriſt Jeſus: The ſum of which is, mans reaſon and his own actions would be the onely righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; but the Lord ſilences that as
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169783:122"/> well as mans perſonal wickedneſs; for in both theſe, call it righteouſneſs or wickedneſs, adverſity or proſperity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay in both, a man may commit homicide, be a ſelf murtherer and deſtroyer; a man may deſtroy himſelf by his righteouſneſs, as well as by his wickedneſs; the Lord ſets one over againſt another, to ſilence mans reaſoning; and the reſult of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that dependence and caſting our care ſhould be on God; yea, he that feareth the Lord, ſhall come forth of them all.</p>
            <p>And thus much by way of Explication; the next thing is by way of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that I obſerve, is from the time; Here is a day, and a day; <hi>A day of proſperity,</hi> and <hi>A day of adverſity:</hi> From which I gather,</p>

And that our days are but
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169783:123"/> two in regard of ſwiftneſs, <hi>Job</hi> tells us, <hi>That his days are ſwifter then a Poſt; they</hi>

               <hi>flee away, they are paſſed away, as the ſwift ſhip, that glides ſtrongly and quickly through the main without ſtay or ſtop:</hi> even ſo the days of our life are but ſhort and ſwift. Our Saviour tells us it is like the graſs that to day is, and to morrow is thrown into the oven: The beſt of us all can number our days but into two; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeſterday and to day; yeſterday was ours, and to day is ours; but to morrow is not mine nor yours, but the Lords. And the Lord help us, that having but two days, and that both ſwift and ſhort, that we may apply our hearts, and imploy our time unto heavenly wiſdom.</p>
            <p>But then Thirdly, as two days in regard ſhortneſs and ſwiftneſs, ſo in regard of uncertainty; The time is certain, but the day is uncertain; who knows what a day may bring forth? one day is fair, but the next foul; one lowring, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerene; yeſterday rainy, to day ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and uſually one or both is intermixt; the morning fair, the noon orecaſt; one hour fair, the next hour cloudy; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſubject unto ſuch like changes: And
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169783:124"/> what elſe is the conſiſtency of mans life, but two days of uncertainty? a day of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a day of health; a day of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a day of plenty; a day of ſtrength, and a day of weakneſs; a day of youth, and a day of age; this hour crowned, the next croſt; our whole life is but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uncertain condition; like the buckets to the well, ſometimes up, and ſometimes down; ſometimes full, and ſometimes empty; one while whole, and anon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; ſuch are the viciſſitudes and changes of the life of man in this preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And the reaſon is, that all things might appear to be of God, and not of man: The Lord caſts all into contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and works in them and by them, take them in nature or grace, to the ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the reaſon of man, who would ſtill be judging according to preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. The world conſiſts of heaven and earth; the heavens have influence on the earth; the earth bringing forth as to the heavens; and this by dying, and in dying living; light and darkneſs is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, both flying, yet following one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; death and life is contrary; ſo is fleſh and ſpirit, yet live in one another: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:169783:124"/> is oppoſite, and againſt proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet in Gods order they make a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; though to man they are contrary, yet from him they are both alike; <hi>He ſetteth one, &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe in ſpirituals, he gives his work out upon the ſoul in reaſons contrarieties: The north wind, <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 16.</note> and the ſouth wind muſt blow together, that his garden may flouriſh, and the ſpices be fragrant. Reaſon would think that the way ſhould be ſomething ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the home; but this is the Lords method unto his deareſt children, that through ſtraights and troubles, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tribulations, they muſt inherit the promiſes, and enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</p>
            <p>But now albeit that all in this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and temporal condition, all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in two days, <hi>A day of proſperity, and of adverſity;</hi> both theſe being ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which would we chuſe? I know if reaſon might make choice, it would fix on proſperity; and ſenſe likewiſe, without queſtion, would cloſe with that: But now what ſaith Religion, and a gracious heart? Saith Religion as to my preſent ſtate, <hi>Give me neither proſperity or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:169783:125"/> as extreams; <hi>Give me neither pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

But ſaith a gracious heart, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my natural inclination, if I muſt chuſe, I had rather pitch upon adverſity; for that will put me to conſideration, which proſperity ſeldom or never doth, but rather into carnal ſecurity.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Well, but ſaith the godly heart, let it be what it will, rather then to forget God, and be puft up, this is my choyce; And this is both their motto's and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond obſervation is from what man doth in the proſperous day; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in the day of proſperity; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders not as commanded, but as from ſenſe and reaſons practice. Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That man keeps a meaſure, according to</hi>

               <hi>preſent events.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he counts changes proſperous, then ſuitable thereunto he treads his joy; but if contrary, he takes up ſorrow: If things run thus and thus, ſaith reaſon, then I ſhall do ſo and ſo; but if things fall thus,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169783:125"/> then muſt I do thus and thus: If ſuch an intereſt be advanced, that is ſuitable unto ſelf; or ſuch opinions ſtand, that are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my intereſt, then accordingly is my joy: But if mine be oppoſed, ſuppreſt, and others to be advanced, then on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we meaſure out our ſorrow, and our grief, keeping a proportion, ſo much and ſo much proſperity, ſo much and ſo much joy, and contrary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe mans reaſon is annexed to ſenſe; rejoycing, that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto proſperity; grief unto diſtreſs; but both by reaſons rule, according to their meaſure in occaſions, whether they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, or interior.</p>
            <p>Learn hence, a clear difference betwixt Faith and Reaſon. Reaſon keepeth mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with every preſent joy or ſorrow: But true faith ſoars above either: Divine faith, it fixes on nothing but All ſufficiency; in diſtreſſes faith acts above ſtaggerings; and in temptations above (though under) ſtruglings. True faith is not frighted by the worlds diſtreſſes, nor heightned by the world<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſucceſs: but in either reaſon's mov'd, and bringet forth fleeting joy or worldly ſorrow.</p>
            <p>The third Obſervation is, <hi>That all our</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:169783:126"/> 
               <hi>earthly comforts, and all our earthly croſſes, are but things that are made by him that made all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord makes one againſt another, and values them both alike in number, weight and meaſure, which are not to remain, but to be removed: All earthly Kingdoms, Crowns and Comforts will be ſhaken, as things that are made; ſo alſo all earthly croſſes will be ſhaken, for that they are made, <hi>that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken might remain,</hi> Heb. 12. 27.</p>
            <p>And if this be ſo, then here is a comfort and a croſs:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If all our earthly comforts &amp; enjoyments are but things that are made; What a croſs is this to the carnal, covetous and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man? All thy worldly joy, profit, and proſperity, it is but made, and ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; nay, they muſt all ſhortly, if not ſuddenly, be removed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is a comfort to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and ſuch as are in this worlds ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; do not be caſt down at anothers proſperity, or thy own poverty; for thy poverty is but made, and in a little while ſhall be removed.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt obſervation, is from the laſt clauſe in the Verſe, which hinteth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169783:126"/> out the ſcope and end why the Lord ſetteth proſperity and adverſity in ſuch anaequipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and that is, To ſilence mans reaſon in determining by preſent events: <hi>He ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth one thing over againſt another, that man ſhould not finde out any thing after him.</hi>

            <p>Whence obſerve, <hi>That it is a folly for man to judge or determine by the preſent even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

Sometimes the wicked are in great proſperity; otherwhiles the godly in great adverſity: And to judge and determine by the preſent condition,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169783:127"/> how may we condemn the godly with the wicked, all things in this world falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all? how miſerably err'd the Jews in thus determining upon Jeſus Chriſt in his preſent diſtreſs? <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 40. 43. by deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining by the preſent event, that made an if, and a piff at the Lord Jeſus, calling all in queſtion, Saying, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs:</hi> Alas miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude! the Father had another end; for in ſparing of his Son, all ſouls had been loſt: But though this was the folly of the multitude, the more learned and great ones would not miſtake ſo: The Scribes and Phariſees they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, they would not be ſo ignorant in Divine things, to judge of Jeſus Chriſt by preſent ſufferings: But not onely they, ſaith the 41 Verſe, not onely the Elders and Scribes, but the great Rabbies, the chief-Prieſts mocked him, ſaying, <hi>He ſaved o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, himſelf he cannot ſave; he truſted in God, let him deliver him if he will have him,</hi> &amp;c. Here is miſerable folly from Chriſts preſent adverſity: Who would ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine by preſent events, when the Jews thus foiled in the Saviour of the world! upon which <hi>David</hi> crys out in the behalf of Chriſt, <hi>Many there be that ſay of my ſoul, there is no help, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe we live more by ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, then we do by faith, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods ordering and diſpoſing of all things: We judge all ſafe in a calm; but if once the Sea is boiſtrous, we like <hi>Peter</hi>

And then</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſon of ſo great a folly is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not onely live more by ſenſe then we do by faith, becauſe we look more upon the preſent event, then upon the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principal; we are more taken up with the preſent effect and inſtrumental cauſe, then we are on God, who is the orderer and diſpoſer, and cauſe of all cauſes.</p>
            <p>The Jews regarded not the Lords deſign in the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> but judged by preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, which makes the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3, 4. <hi>He is deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of men,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>a man of ſorrows;</hi> but what then? what did they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine? <hi>why, notwithſtanding bearing our</hi>

               <hi>grief, and carrying our ſorrows,</hi> looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his preſent diſtreſs, more then the Lords great deſign: <hi>yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted;</hi> they looked more upon the Lord Jeſus preſent afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then upon the Lords eternal deſigns.</p>
            <p>So in a Summers day, we think it will never be night in ſuch a ſtate or condition, never any alteration. But now did we but conſider the power, and the Lords decrees, and reſolved accompliſhments; how he in this world plants and pulls up; and theſe things alike to all, as proſperity and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: If we did but conſider how quickly he can alter Crowns and Kingdoms, ſhake and remove, level mountains, and exalt valleys, we would reſt more on God, and determine leſs amongſt our ſelves in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tranſactions.</p>
